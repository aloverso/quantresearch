P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:16 [Whether what they were doing w..]  (44:44)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

Whether what they were doing was spinning fire or figuring out how to do a design challenge, or, um, or everything they were, everything they were doing, people were so passionate about.  Um, and I always felt a little bit like a _____ [00:03:09]  in high school that I was really excited about things, and most of my peers were maybe not so excited about them.

P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:15 [Um, and that was my plan when ..]  (138:138)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

Um, and that was my plan when I took that leave of absence to go teach in inner city Boston, um, and I loved the teaching.  I don't _____ [00:07:28] teaching, but it sort of reminded me how much I really loved teaching one on one.

P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:40 [I mean, we...I learned an incred..]  (221:221)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

I mean, we...I learned an incredible amount, um, and I had chosen Olin in part because I was totally fine with the idea of doing non-traditional teaching, and I loved the fact that I was learning rapidly, even if it was really hard, even if _____, [00:19:07] I really needed to go take a nap.  Um, so, I don't know.  I thought it was pretty awesome.


P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:101 [Uh, they were always the very ..]  (469:469)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [teaching model - express]

Uh, they were always the very open and, uh, interested and passionate about things, just like the students, um, and the fact that they were really interested and passionate about teaching made it much easier to come ask whatever questions you had, whether or not they were, 'I don't understand the material,' or, 'I want to understand further about this material than we're technically required to.'  Um, the faculty were genuinely there to teach, definitely made it much, much easier to learn. 

P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:104 [I mean, you can see where I en..]  (485:485)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

I mean, you can see where I ended up, in medicine with an MBA, technical _____, [00:53:38]  just not where my interest or passion really was.  So, _____ [00:53:45] again, I didn't notice it as much as if I really, really was excited about being a hard-core _____. [00:53:53] 

P 7: 03-17-14-1-Fred.rtf - 7:9 [Um, I just sort of sat down in..]  (61:61)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [excitement] [fun]

Um, I just sort of sat down in the cafeteria with a couple of Olin students, and something like an hour went by, and we'd just been talking about cars, and modifications that one of them wanted to do in the speaker systems, and, uh, one of them had a job at Bose for a while, and we just talked about things for an hour, and they were really, really excited, and that was a pre-start contract to a lot of the other tech schools that I'd seen, um, where people were sort of head down focused on studies all the time, um, sort of depressed compared to the sort of feeling of Olin.  There's a lot of energy, there's a lot of just positive, interested, passionate energy there, um, especially among the student body, and the other candidates.  It was a really fun, fast bonding experience with the other candidates, um, activities, and, um, yeah...building things together, having groups, and actual time to communicate with the other candidates was good.  Yeah.  It was really, really great.  

P 8: 03-17-14-2-Betty.rtf - 8:83 [So, um, I'm...I think beyond, uh..]  (154:154)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [excitement]

 So, um, I'm...I think beyond, uh, beyond everything else what I would say is that I learned really well from, uh, people who are around me, and so this can be from professors, it can also just be from my peers, um, and I'm sort of like parasitic in the sense that, like, when people are really  excited about something, it's really, like, I can catch that enthusiasm pretty easily, and so, I think that there are a lot of opportunities in it, and I think now if I think about it anymore I did do this a lot where, I just knew cool people who were working on cool projects.  So, like why not, why not help them out, and learn a little something for myself at the same time.  Um, I do think that, um, most students at Olin are really interested in a lot of different things.  Uh, they work hard on a lot of projects that aren't even class related, and so, even if you don't have something, it's still easy to find someone who does, and just sort of like, join in on that.  Um, I guess it was my original hope by going to Olin anyway, so.

P 8: 03-17-14-2-Betty.rtf - 8:98 [Um, I think I'm more open mind..]  (170:170)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

Um, I think I'm more open minded, and I think I'm actually, I think it's like moral obligation, or guilt or something.  I always do such negative turns, I don't know why, but I do really feel that like, I should, I can, and should, um, be involved to try and make a difference, um, and I think that's the thing that keeps bringing me back.  I don't know how many times in this interview I told you I hate teaching, I keep trying to find some things that I can do, uh, to contribute, and I can see that it makes a difference, and I don't know.  I'm always trying to bug other people too, like participate in events, or join like the Literacy Project, or something like that.  Uh, I truly believe that they make a difference, and I really have respect for the people that commit to things like that, and so, uh, I think it makes me want to be more involved.  It makes me want to try to get more people involved, and it makes me try to recognize those who are already involved.

P 9: 03-13-15-1 - Ellie.rtf - 9:4 [But it wasn't until I went to ..]  (21:21)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [Candidate's Weekend]

 But it wasn't until I went to candidates' weekend, uh, and saw the school kind of having taken shape and with this community of really awesome people who were very passionate about things, that I knew that that was the only school I wanted to go to.  Um, my parents, who can be very skeptical about things, um, both came to candidates' weekend and both absolutely agreed that, you know, this school was ridiculously awesome, and I would be great there.

P 9: 03-13-15-1 - Ellie.rtf - 9:9 [Um, the faculty that I met at ..]  (31:31)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

Um, the faculty that I met at other schools cared very little about teaching.  It was shocking to me.  Um, and the faculty I met at Olin were so very vocal in their passion for their subjects, and their subjects weren't just, you know, math; they were math and something else.  They weren't just biology; it was biology and art.  You know, it wasn't just engineering, it was engineering and design.  Olin really understood how to respect the whole person, the whole community, the whole school, um, in one integrated unit.

P 9: 03-13-15-1 - Ellie.rtf - 9:32 [Hmm, and then geographically. ..]  (161:161)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

Hmm, and then geographically.  I'll be honest.  I mean, I love...Olin teaches you to be passionate about things, and I really find that I'm passionate about biking to work.  It's cathartic, it's exercise, it's happens to be good for the environment, and if my work was too far away, I wouldn't be able to do that.  So, I don't know.  I guess I'm just picky.

P 9: 03-13-15-1 - Ellie.rtf - 9:78 [*laughs* Um, I really, really ..]  (375:375)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

*laughs*  Um, I really, really appreciate instructors, educators, trainers, who are passionate about their material and want to get the information across.  They don't resign themselves to the fact that this may be a required training course.  They don't resign themselves to the fact that most people just won't care.  Um, they just...they have passionate enthusiasm, and they convey the material.  Now, all of a sudden, it's not just a class; it's a story.  Or, it's a show, and you're engaged.  I mean, to me, that's a really, really big deal.  

P 9: 03-13-15-1 - Ellie.rtf - 9:103 [I really enjoyed creating the ..]  (460:460)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion]

I really enjoyed creating the course work, the slides and the exercises and whatnot.  Um, and when I have been asked to participate in course presentations, um, either because they need a substitute, or they needed someone who knew the material for this particular one-off thing, I always come off with a passion for the thing I'm teaching.  And one of my skills, generally, is listening to what the person asks, and answering what their actual question is.  Um, a lot of teachers have some sort of interesting filter when a student asks a question, and they don't actually answer it, or they talk around it.  Um, and so I've had not only a personal interest in doing that as a career, but I've had people offer me, um, positions.  Just, I haven't had the right time yet, so...

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:4 [But Olin felt, you know...they..]  (54:54)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [cultural norms]

But Olin felt, you know...they were different types of clubs, and there were, you know, people who had passions outside of engineering, and, you know, everyone had to have passion to get in.  It was kind of the application process.  So, you just felt right away that it was, it was something different, um, and it wasn't just a place where people only liked math and science and putting things together and robot things, you know, but kind of a different home-front approach to engineering. 

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:6 [Well, probably not. *laughs* U..]  (69:69)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [diverse perspectives]

Well, probably not.  *laughs*  Uh, I, I sort of had, in my mind, that I didn't want to be just, uh, end up, you know, only knowing people who did all of the same things.  So I guess, uh, you know, I was thinking more of going to schools where there were lots of different majors, so there were people with widely different interests in that regard.  But at Olin, people had different interests, but they, I guess, just manifested those differently, because we all had in common that we were, you know, math and science type minded people, and, you know, we were all interested in engineering, but within that, we all had our own unique, uh, passions as well.  So...

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:9 [And she chatted with me for a ..]  (126:126)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [excitement]

And she chatted with me for a while, and we came to this, this concept of teaching, and, you know, kind of relating the excitement and passion that, uh, that Olin had inspired in me, that, you know, so much about to learn at Olin.

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:51 [Uh, I think it means a, oh, a ..]  (484:484)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [faculty connection] [teaching model - express]

Uh, I think it means a, oh, a lot of things. I think it means a role model.  I think it means a, uh, a source of, uh, really some information.  I think it means, um, someone who's going to look out for you and support you.  Um, hang on a sec. I think, yeah, I think a _____ [00:36:50] caring and passionate person.  Uh, I think, you know, you have to love your students, and you have to love what you're teaching in order to be a good teacher, and I think, you know, if you were getting that sense of passion across, it's the best.  It's the best part about teaching, so...


P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:72 [*laughs* Um, I think...I think..]  (714:714)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [excitement]

*laughs*  Um, I think...I think, like, seeing the kids, you know, come back and be like, 'Oh, my gosh, this is so cool,' or, 'Oh, did you realize that...' whatever it is.  And I think, uh, just like seeing them excited about it gets me excited about teaching.  So I think, um, you know, those are my favorite moments of, uh...because those students' excitement and passion about something is just, is really cool, so...

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:76 [So, uh, I, I think I did a lot..]  (762:762)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [confidence/empowerment] [excitement]

So, uh, I, I think I did a lot of my own learning, uh, because I was kind of excited and passionate about the subject too, and so I kind of...I taught myself some things, and on my...um, I...so I ended up feeling pretty confident in the subject area.

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:84 [It's to me that, like, takes a..]  (805:805)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [excitement] [teaching model - express]

It's to me that, like, takes away from the whole point of being a teacher, you know?  Having interactions with students where you're, like, getting them excited and passionate about learning.  I

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:85 [Uh, maybe all of the above. [L..]  (815:815)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [career] [content/skill learning] [decision]
          [reflections on wanting]

Uh, maybe all of the above.  *laughs*  So, not formal, like, not being called _____ [01:02:17], not called 'teacher,' or maybe, you know, not K through 12, or maybe not, uh, public school.  But I haven't quite figured out what that is yet, so, I'm still trying to figure out that, the next step for myself.  But, uh, like, I mean there's lot of jobs where you can be in a completely different role, and you don't have to, you know, teach someone else to learn this piece of equipment.  You know, how do I use this, whatever it is.  You know, so...but that's something I could see myself being really passionate about, um, you know, maybe something along those lines, but I don't know quite exactly what yet.  

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:87 [Okay. Um, that one. *laughs* S..]  (841:841)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [interest/learning combo] [limited opportunity]

Okay.  Um, that one.  *laughs*  So, I felt, as a girl at Olin - well, maybe at Olin - that I maybe didn't have as many opportunities, either prior to Olin or at Olin, to access some of those more like...let's say I didn't really learn how to code.  And that's virtually on me.  Um, but I also felt that it was partially - and this is, you know, where I felt like a lot of the boys that came in had already experienced some of that.  And for whatever reason - I don't know if that was just because they were passionate about it, they pursued it, or actually it kind of was presented to them as something they should do, or that wasn't presented to me.  

P11: 03-20-15-2 - Karen.rtf - 11:96 [Um, well, I think for the most..]  (900:900)   (Super)
Codes:  [passion] [confidence/empowerment] [teaching model - express]

Um, well, I think for the most part, Olin professors are really supportive and caring and, um, passionate about both their students and what they teach.  And I, like, I kind of _____ [01:12:26].  I think those are the most important parts of teaching.  And I think, you know, I really think that the professors do everything in their power to reach out to students and make everybody feel like, you know, really awesome.  *laughs*  So...

Codes:  [accident] [decision] [reflections on wanting]

But even with that, I had no idea what engineering was, and even though I was in American Math and Science School, I wanted to be an art graphic design major.  Um, I told my parents this; they had serious objection to this idea and I thought, 'Well, then what do you want me to study?'  And they said, 'You're good at math and science; you should do engineering' and I didn't know what that was, but it was something they wanted me to study.  So, I looked into that and I realized that it made more sense than the other options that they told me that I could consider.  It was, 'Now that we are in America, you have four options for your career: medicine, law, business, or engineering - pick one.'  And engineering seemed to me like the most creative one and the closest I would be able to get to art, so, um, I started applying to engineering colleges and fortunately that ended up being a good fit.  But it was incredibly accidental.  I didn't choose engineering and I didn't get interested in engineering until I had already basically decided I was going to study engineering whether I was interested or not.

P 2: 07-16-14-1-Christine.rtf - 2:20 [Olin started out as a bit of a..]  (57:57)   (Super)
Codes:  [accident]

Olin started out as a bit of an accident, so one of, one of my friends at my high school in the class directly above mine had actually become a member of the class of 2006, so I guess I had a little bit of an unusual advantage that a lot of Olin students in my class wouldn't have had.

P 2: 07-16-14-1-Christine.rtf - 2:32 [Um, a number of things. Um, pr..]  (97:105)   (Super)
Codes:  [accident]

Um, a number of things.  Um, primarily two things.  The first thing is that immediately after graduation, I worked on, um, open-source projects largely in educational technology or education-related fields so, um, working with educational software that was open source, working on open hardware that was open source, um, and then running workshops for professors who were getting their students involved in open-source projects.  So that was the first part of my career.  And then the second part, which started three years ago, was I started doing my PhD in engineering education.

Interviewer:

Okay.  What made you pick those directions?
[00:12:58]
Participant:

Um, so, pretty...still kind of as accidents.

Yeah.  Um, a lot of, a lot of my...I lot of situations and things that led me to doing engineering education stemmed from very, very happy accidents that I only realized in hindsight.

Certainly, like, Ben and _____ [01:08:33] were the two design faculty, um, and so, I was interested in product design, and both of the faculty happened to be male so, um, that's just the way the cards played out.

Codes:  [accident]

Um, similarly, I was interested in anthropology and Caitrin  happened to be the female professor there.  Um, so, that was, um, again, just sort of felt like how things worked out.  Um, I...like, there were...um, thinking of other faculty...um, I don't think that it was as much of a gender, like, thing...like, sort of gender-shaped connections with people as, um, probably more subject areas and domain sort of perspectives.

Codes:  [accident]

I found myself in an OR, shadowing and, bizarrely, the other person in the OR with me that day was a medical student from Harvard who had been a neural engineering major all through his undergrad and decided in his senior year to go to medical school, and that kind of _____ [00:08:32] went on, and I went, oh, teaching, taking care of people, science:  Oh, I should have figured out I was supposed to be a doctor a long time ago.

Codes:  [accident]

Pre-college career was definitely much more regimented.  Um, with what I've seen from other colleges and other technical schools, they tend to be much more regimented too.  I just got lucky, and took the path that had a lot of freedom in it.

Codes:  [accident]

Hmm, hmm.  Um, let's see, I immediately took off almost immediately for a three month back packing trip around Europe, um, moved to Egypt at the end of that.  Um, in Egypt it was mostly just, uh, hanging out in café's, and meeting people, and, um, I started to get more, and more broke, uh, looking for a job, and then, uh, found a job not doing the usual pathways, but just by...well, I guess it was maybe the usual pathway, but just hanging out with friends at a café, found a job teaching English, uh, and that was sort of a first experience teaching as well.  Um, so, that was through, um, let's see, like, summer, May or so of 2008.  Uh, then I hitch hiked around, wondered around Europe a little bit more, went back to states, hitch hiked to...got a job, uh, back at my old company, um, working in engineering back in San Diego for, for...and occasional winter breaks during college and...um, finished six months or so there, and oh yeah, going to national parks, and hiking, and doing all sorts of other things, um, and then, took a bicycle trip around Europe for about a month and a half or so.  Moved to Italy, uh, found a job there teaching, and driving a car for a wealthy business man.  This is like, uh, summer of 2009 or so.  Um, rode a bike solo up to the Netherlands, uh, hitch hiked across the states.  I was hitch hiking with a bicycle that was a lot of fun.  Um, found Burning Man  sort of accidentally through the hitch hiking community, um, found other festivals as well.  So, since then I've been going to Burning Man every summer except for the last one, um, and a couple of those summers was really, really diving into festivals, and festival planning, event planning, event logistics, um, all the while not doing engineering, um, had sort of dropped out of engineering around, I think around 2010, no, 2011.  I'm looking at my calendar, clicking through it at the moment.  Um, so, oh, yeah, and one more quick trip to Europe in 2011, um, and yeah.  I was bouncing back and forth between the Bay area, and  San Diego, um, and working odd jobs, taxi driver up in the Bay area, um, whatever I could find down in San Diego.  I was cleaning pool filters for a little while, and then, uh, tutoring through, uh, just a Craig's List posting, a No Child Left Behind tutoring job, uh, poorly supported, and not the best job ever, but, uh, working with the kids.  Um, and then, yeah, I kept doing some festival things, moved up to the Bay area, and found the current teaching job that I'm at right now after a couple of months.

Codes:  [accident]

I found that teaching job, was pretty good at it, um, and then, when I got back to the states too, uh, I was sort of curious if I could continue that, and went to the tutoring, um, business down in San Diego, um, and that was with no sort of education, or credentials around education, and then, up in the Bay area, um, you know, a year later or so, about two years, something like that, um, I wasn't really looking for education related jobs, um, and then, an e-mail popped around from Andrew Eastman saying they were looking for another engineer in the I Lab at their school and the job posting basically sounded exactly like me.

Uh, I think that honestly I was wandering a little bit when I was at Olin, um, and I didn't care if I graduated with an ECE degree because somehow all of my classes turned out that way.  Um, I don't regret it or anything, um, but, it wasn't very well planned

Codes:  [accident] [decision]

Uh, so that...in my senior year, I was kind of unsure of what to do after graduation, and I went to talk to Kelly Baker, and I was, like, 'Oh, you know, there's so many options, I don't even know what I want to do.'  And she chatted with me for a while, and we came to this, this concept of teaching, and, you know, kind of relating the excitement and passion that, uh, that Olin had inspired in me, that, you know, so much about to learn at Olin.  So she was, like, 'Well, why don't you, you know, try to see if there's something you can apply that to,' and she, uh, referred me to go visit the school that her daughter was going at the time, which is the Advanced Math and Science Academy, which is in Marlborough.  And, uh, I kind of went under the impression that I was just going to, you know, visit and see what they were about, and they were going to kind of tell me something about what it would be like as a teacher there, if that was something I decided to do.  And they basically offered me a job when I showed up.  *laughs*  And I was, like, 'Oh, okay.'  So I, I ended up going and working there for next three years, um, so, yeah, it was ______ [00:08:39].  They had a fellowship program, um, that I could work and get my master's in education at the same time.  So that was really appealing to me, so that I had that opportunity, and I took advantage of it, and I worked there for another two and a half years.

Wouldn't she make a great candidate?'  And I was like, 'Oh, my God, I really would love to teach physics.'  *laughs*  It was, like, 'Are you serious?'  And I'm, like, 'Yes, I'm really serious.'  Um, so, _____ [00:13:03], I went and talked with the science director and made sure that everything was good with them, and then they, yeah, they offered me, I guess, you know, within the school, they just transferred my job, but, yeah, they offered me that job, so, yeah.

But I just remember writing on, um, like 50 different sheets of paper, trying to solve out these differential equations and make sense of them and categorize them into, like, you know, 'Oh, this one represents the angular part, and this one represents, you know, the velocity part.'  And, I don't know if that's like...I don't know if I necessarily...like, there was an epiphany or anything, but I do remember, like, throughout first semester for sure, at least the first year, being really overwhelmed.  And I even remember telling myself, 'I think I'm the fourth-dumbest person here.'  And it was, you know, not something that I'm proud of saying, necessarily, but it was definitely a feeling that I had, that I felt like a lot of the people there were just so much more intelligent and had a bigger knowledge base than me.

P: *laughs* Um, he...it was in my sophomore year in the fall, um, sort of before I was declaring major but, like, I was interested in physics and so I thought that was maybe the direction I was going to go.  Um, and he was teaching me modern physics and so I thought, like, 'Oh, you're my physics teacher.  I'm thinking about declaring physics.  You'd be, like, a reasonable person to talk to about this...'

I: Hmm, hmm.
[01:12:32]
P: And so, I set up an appointment with him.  He told me to, like, come to office hours, and I told him that, and he told me not to major in physics.  Um, I think his, his actual words, as I remember them, are, 'Physics isn't a very interesting field right now,' um, and said that I shouldn't do it.  And then, like, a week later, I was in class one day and I was, like, I was pretty early to class because, like, no one else was there yet but he was, um, and all of a sudden he was, like, 'Yeah.  Like, you should major in physics.  Like, I think, like, you really have a gift for it.  Like, you should do it.'  Um, and I realized that that was... between those two times, he had graded out first tests, which meant it was the first time he'd ever actually seen my work...

I: Okay.

P: In a physics class, so it was...like, it was clear to me, or at least it was my interpretation of those events that, like, he had thought I wasn't good at physics.  Like, he, he thought I was dumb...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: And, like, like, there were a lot of times in class when I would, like, ask questions because...like, a lot of the material in the class wasn't new to me at that point and I was, like, disappointed that he wasn't going into more depth.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Like, I had expected it to be in more depth, and it wasn't.  And so, I'd ask questions that tried to get at that a little bit, like, dig a little deeper than what he was telling us, and he would never answer them.  Like, he would always...his response was always to, like, to...he would just say...he would repeat whatever he had said immediately before I asked the question and, like, with a tone that I interpreted as, like, 'I already told you this.  Why don't you get it?'
[01:14:30]
I: Hmm, hmm.

P: When, like, in reality what he was saying was, like, not an answer to the question I had asked.  Um, so, like, between that and the, like, 'Physics isn't interesting' when, like, 'Your career is physics!' *laughs*  Um, I interpreted it as, like, he thought I was no good at physics and so he was telling me not to do it.  And then he saw my test, which I had aced because I was good at physics, and he was, like, 'Oh, just kidding!  You should be a physicist now.'  And that was, like...it was already, like, too late at that point.  I was just, like, 'I, I don't care what you think and I just, like, kind of hate you!'  *laughs*  Um...

I: So, is there anything that happened that led you to believe that those interactions were based on gender?

P: Um, I don't really know.  Like, I didn't...like, that was part of it also.  Like, I never really, like, told other people or, like, professors or, like...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: People...I never told anyone other than students, at least not for a couple of years, about this because, um, like, I...no, like, I don't have proof that it was about gender but, like...

I: Right.

P: I got the impression that it was and, like, it...just looking at, like, the other...the impression...like, just, like, the ways he interacted with, like, other students in the class and that he, like...

I: Okay.
[01:15:50]
P: He was generally clear about who he thought was intelligent and who he thought wasn't.  And, like, it seemed to fall...like, it wasn't a hundred percent, right?  Like, he did think I was smart after that first test, right...

I: Okay.

P: So, it wasn't, like, he never thought a girl was smart, but it did seem to, like, follow a general pattern where it was easier to be smart if you were a guy.

Um, but I had to teach four classes of about roughly 30 students each.  So, the number was a lot to handle, and then, I had never done something on that level before.  Uh, and I just don't...I got really frustrated with my students sometimes because, um, and I always try to put this in perspective, but like, for me, it felt like they weren't trying very hard, um, and they expected me to spoon feed them, like answers to the test or something, or like if they were struggling with their homework for me to do like, talk it out to them, um, and I guess like the way that I learned, and the way that I think is better to learn is that sort of more open ended prodding, of like, pushing them to explore, and also, pushing them to, I don't know, push their knowledge for the sake  of knowledge.  Like...it doesn't really align with everybody's perspective, uh, and that's fine too, uh, but I guess I found that frustrating.  I found like, if I'd been carrying a lot of this class, and they didn't...I found that, uh, frustrating, and again, I mentioned earlier, I have a hard time leading groups of people, uh, and so, and these are like college freshmen too, so  they're gonna be like immature sometimes.  Uh, I just found that whole class difficult, and, um, there was a student with a learning disability in my class, and he was, like his personality was super sweet like, when you just talked to him, but he made me cry so many times, but not in class, but like, after it, I would just go out, and cry for a bit.  Uh, because he...I'm not really sure, uh, what it was, but he would talk a lot during class, uh, and he would get really emotional, and like, if he didn't understand things, or like, things didn't quite work out well for him in the lab, or something.  It was really hard for me to like, try to stay patient, like, okay, its okay, we'll do this over again.  Like, okay, lower your voice. Very emotionally draining, or like, when I'm working with one student and he just interrupts me, or something.  I don't know.  I'm...I don't know how to deal with things like that.  I'm a very like, introverted, uh, quiet person.  So, being bombarded with so many students who had so many expectations of me, and like, who I also felt like, weren't really trying, it was a miserable experience.

Um, this is really tricky.  Uh, probably, but I think in some ways that I was protected a lot at Olin.  Um, I think that the...something close to 50-50 ratio dealt with that.  Um, I do know, and like looking back now, I recognize it better for what it was.  I didn't know that there were like students who made comments like, oh yeah, you can't do this because you're a girl, um, and at that time, like, that really, that really hurt my feelings, but, um, like, I didn't know what to do about it.  Um, I remember thinking that I was stupid.  Um, so, now when I think about that I get so pissed off, um, and, uh, I mentioned a few times that I worked with AWIS which is the Association of Women In Science, and I'm actually  the chapter secretary for that.  So, like we do a lot of, like, even just on like, our Facebook page, or something, sharing of like of these articles like, studies about females and science, and like how these gender stereotypes are still there, and still like compose you to grow, um, which I think like is also becoming a more popular topic recently which I'm really happy about.  Um, I, I'm not really sure how much you can do except like spread awareness.  One of the reasons here that we do the downtown science project thing, um, is also in addition to like, helping the students in this area like, become more excited about science.  Like, it's also like, here we are like, female scientists, and engineers, and we're out here, and like, know that we exist, know that like, like if you are a girl you can do it too, or if you are a guy, and you see a girl doing science, it's not a weird thing, and it's not something that they can't do.  Um, I very strongly believe in, in making that happen because I think that like, I held back a little bit, um, in college because of this perception that I was like too stupid to be there, um, and, uh, I don't want girls to go through that.  Um, and I don't want anybody to go through that, and I think a lot of people at Olin actually struggle with the feeling that they don't think that they're smart enough to be there, that you definitely should not ever think it because of like your background, because that's like something that you can't help at all.  Um, and I think that...the hard thing is that I know that it's still holds me back a little bit.  Um, it's real easy to see like, studies of like, yeah you know, same resume, one girl name, one guy name, who do people think like are  more talented or skilled, like, the statistics will be like the guy, and I'm like, I don't know.  That's just depressing, I don't know.  So, you try to work to change it.

You were nothing to them but a wallet.  Um, the curriculum really did no justice to the subject matter, from my perspective.  Um, and the syllabi of the classes were not designed to teach.  They were designed to convey whatever material they wanted to test, um, in your exam or your project or your paper.  And, to me that was just a travesty of education.

Everyone's philosophy on, kind of...nothing was competitive, right?  It was all about sharing ideas, sharing perspective, getting to something that would be beneficial for the entire group.  And that really appealed to me because I thought that's the best way that you can, um, I don't know, kind of absorb the most mind knowledge; versus other schools might have individual competitions or something.  Everyone's kind of in their own little bubble, doesn't want to share their secrets or what they know.  It's kind of the concept of, you know, the more mind you have, the smarter you are as a whole.  So, after that, I just totally fell in love with Olin and definitely wanted to go after the candidates' weekend.

 But it wasn't until I went to candidates' weekend, uh, and saw the school kind of having taken shape and with this community of really awesome people who were very passionate about things, that I knew that that was the only school I wanted to go to.  Um, my parents, who can be very skeptical about things, um, both came to candidates' weekend and both absolutely agreed that, you know, this school was ridiculously awesome, and I would be great there.

Um, I mean, to some extent, I was still living in a culture where people thought that girls don't do science and engineering, um, which was always reinforced to me whenever I applied to schools or visited them.  I'd have people who'd tell me I needed to come to their school just because they needed their girl numbers up.  I was, like, really?  That's why you want me?  Um, so, being on a group project at candidates' weekend, um, with blue foam, trying to make a...they wouldn't call it a bridge, but they called it a structure that had a certain span and a certain height of said span and had to support weight.  

Um, you know, our team built a blue-foam bridge, and they went with my design, which was kind of like an interlocking, notched design, without, you know, any external fasteners.  Um, and when they were ratcheting down the rebar on top of our, our bridge, they couldn't figure out why the meter had stopped working, and it's because the rebar was bending.  *laughs*  So force was going through the rebar instead of going through the force meter.  So they had to go get a new stick of steel to test the other bridges, because we broke their test setup.  [Both laugh]  I'm like, okay, I think, I think I've probably got what it takes.  I think you can let me in, not just because I'm a girl, and you need your numbers to look good.  I think you can let me in because I can do this.  

Um, I also really appreciated, um...during the group interview, at one point I completely and totally misunderstood what they were asking us to do.  Uh, they give a prompt and instructions, and I thought they were giving us something that sounded like a skit form from Whose Line Is It Anyway, and in doing that, I was basically stepping on everyone's toes because I had completely misunderstood.  And they didn't just get mad, and they didn't, you know, cut me off and tell me, 'No, no, no; that's not what we meant to do.'  You know, they were so nice about it.  They, they took a second and observed, and they realized, 'Oh, she just completely misinterpreted what was just said,' and they were very generous in their redirecting of the conversation back to where I was supposed to be.  And I appreciated that, you know.  They didn't, in passing, make you feel bad to completely change your behavior.  

Um, and doing the individual interview, apparently they were asking everyone the same questions while they finished their notes from the previous interview.  The question was, you know, while we finish our notes, would you care to show us an interpretive dance?  And everyone else apparently had declined, but I guess I'm a little outgoing, so I decided to do an interpretive dance.  So, yeah, I was...uh, I demonstrated, you know, a chicken hatching from its egg and plucking around and learning to peck for food and learning to flap its wings, and my interpretive dance ended with the actual Chicken Dance, na-na-na-na-na-da-da-da. [Participant laughs]  Um, so I'm fairly convinced that's actually why I got into Olin, because I was the only person that did the interpretive dance.  Um, but anyway, I mean, it was just such a unique experience of students and faculty who cared about their environment in, um, ways that I felt l could contribute to that.  So that was great.

Um, which is a lot different, but the way I got into it was because one of the companies that was, um, that my specific boss was looking for a person on, was a renewable energy company, sort of.  They were called Harvest Power, now called Harvest, I think, and they're based out of Waltham, but they have...basically, they own a lot of technology on anaerobic digestion, and that's what I did; you know, a big part of a few of my projects at Olin.  And so I got involved with them doing that project and worked a lot on that specific company in launching their brand and working with them to develop that and launch it in Canada and across the western United States too.  
But then I got involved in other, you know, other brand launches in other things, which is cool, um, and I brought more of, like, and analytical perspective to the company.  But then I moved back to southern California, where I grew up, maybe after two years, and now I've been working at a consulting firm in southern California for energy efficiency.  So our major clients are utilities, and we design and implement energy efficiency programs for them.  So that's more along the lines of, I don't know, the energy aspect that I want to be involved in, and...not as much engineering, but definitely a lot of project management.

So, I mean, I know our society tends to define teachers as someone who works in a school, and earns their full-time living doing that.  And they define a trainer as somebody who works in a company and earns their full-time living doing that.  But, but then they often cross that over with parents to constantly teaching their kids.

Okay.  Um, so, I know you're not in a teaching career, per se, but have you ever considered become a teacher?

Ellie:

Yeah.  Um, teacher in the sense of, like, professional trainer, doing corporate courses.

Interviewer:
 
Okay.  So, what led you to think you would enjoy that?

Ellie:

I really enjoyed creating the course work, the slides and the exercises and whatnot.  Um, and when I have been asked to participate in course presentations, um, either because they need a substitute, or they needed someone who knew the material for this particular one-off thing, I always come off with a passion for the thing I'm teaching.  And one of my skills, generally, is listening to what the person asks, and answering what their actual question is.  Um, a lot of teachers have some sort of interesting filter when a student asks a question, and they don't actually answer it, or they talk around it.  Um, and so I've had not only a personal interest in doing that as a career, but I've had people offer me, um, positions.  Just, I haven't had the right time yet, so...

After I graduated I went to law school.  Um, I have three years in law school.  I graduated and then ended up working, uh, at a big law firm in Dallas, this international law firm.  It had I think about 1,000 attorneys at the time.  Um, I spent about a year there and, um, after that I decided to switch to a much smaller place, so I've worked in a firm with about I think we have like 10 or 12 attorneys now.  Um, I work in patent litigation.  So, uh, it involves, um, a lot of law and, uh, quite a bit of engineering, understanding of engineering and technology concepts.  Most of the work that I do right now is in cell phone, uh, litigation.  So, it involves understanding the inner workings of, uh, cell phones and, um, cell phone networks.  Uh, sort of various bits and pieces of information that, um, not much of which I learn the concepts regarding when I was at Olin.  So, it's, uh, kind of nice to use both my sort of law school education and my engineering education at the same time.

Yeah.  I mean I'd love to go teach, but, um, I think I'd like to teach high school physics, uh, but, uh, student loans are a deterrent.  Um, I still owe a lot of money from law school and I probably still need...I mean I would still have to go away and get a further degree I think to really I don't know be proud of myself as a physics teacher.  I think I would at least need a masters degree.  Um, although I'm pretty sure you can get away with teaching high school physics with just a Bachelor's Degree, but, um, I think I'd probably want to refresh my knowledge and at least get a Master's Degree, um, before I went off doing that.  Um, so, that's sort of where that lies.  Um, there are other things I might teach.  I enjoy the thought of being able to explain concepts to students and make them...or help them, not make them...help them understand it, um, rather than just, you know, shoot at them with a fire hose, you know.

Yeah.  So I've been, uh, actually teaching in, uh, a middle school - a couple of different middle schools.  So I've been teaching math and science to 6th or 7th graders over the past six years, and it's kind of been a whole different world of experience.  *laughs*  You know, it's totally unrelated to the degree, I guess, but, I mean, it's math and it's science, so that's related, but yeah.

Yeah.  So, after my third year, uh, I was sort of getting frustrated by a couple of things, uh, with AMSA.  I, I mean, I loved my courses, but it was all the way in Marlborough, when I was living in Somerville, and that was getting very frustrating, driving back and forth every day.  And so, I was kind of looking for other opportunities, and, you know, I still really enjoyed teaching, and I really was, uh, excited about teaching science, because I had done it for a year and saw just how much fun kids were having with learning that _____ [00:17:21] stuff.  So I applied to a lot of middle school science positions, um, and then I heard back from Belmont Middle School, and they had a position that was, um, half math and half science, so, uh, you know, basically the way it worked, I thought of being _____ [00:17:45] for math and learning, but I was offered science in the afternoon, and so, you know, I had experience in both math and science and, um, it was just the right fit for me.  So, uh, and it was a lot closer, and, um, you know, it just had a lot of other benefits that went along with it.

I was, like, 'Oh, I guess maybe.'  Um, so, yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of one of those weird moments.  Yeah, I don't...it was like I said I kind of...I was very unsure of, like, what to do, and even with my major, I did so much of everything, that I didn't even know, like, what I was focused on.  I'm, like, kind of all over the place.  And so, I didn't know where to go after graduation.  I didn't know, like, what kind of engineering I would want to do, or if engineering was even really the right thing.  Uh, so, you know, when she was, like, well, what was _____ [00:59:47], then I told her the story, and she was, like, 'Well, you know, think about it.  Try it and see how it goes.'  And here I am, six years later, still teaching.  *laughs*  So, something went right, I guess.  So...

Um, I'm going to say no, but maybe not teaching in a school, but maybe teaching in a different sense.

Interviewer:

Can you say more about that? 

Karen:

*laughs*  Uh, so, recently, I've been feeling very constrained by education, just the system in general.  I felt a lot of the, uh, a lot of the expectations for teachers had shifted away actual teaching into more of, you know,  _____ [01:00:48] was like 400 documents of things you have to do, like, you know, to prove that you're teaching.  It's to me that, like, takes away from the whole point of being a teacher, you know?  Having interactions with students where you're, like, getting them excited and passionate about learning.  I don't know.  

So, I think, uh, I think of those, those little...they're all little things, but they all...all the little things add up to a lot, and I think all those little things are wearing on me.  And so, I don't see myself staying in the classroom for another six years, but I don't really know what's next either, so I don't want to give up those awesome moments of, you know, 'Oh, gosh, that was so cool,' and, like, you know, I was able to help them, or whatever it is.  So I don't want to give that part of it up.  So that might mean maybe teaching in high school or...but, yeah, I don't think it will be in the classroom, because of that.

But, uh, like, I mean there's lot of jobs where you can be in a completely different role, and you don't have to, you know, teach someone else to learn this piece of equipment.  You know, how do I use this, whatever it is.

Uh, so that...in my senior year, I was kind of unsure of what to do after graduation, and I went to talk to Kelly Baker, and I was, like, 'Oh, you know, there's so many options, I don't even know what I want to do.'  And she chatted with me for a while, and we came to this, this concept of teaching, and, you know, kind of relating the excitement and passion that, uh, that Olin had inspired in me, that, you know, so much about to learn at Olin.  So she was, like, 'Well, why don't you, you know, try to see if there's something you can apply that to,' and she, uh, referred me to go visit the school that her daughter was going at the time, which is the Advanced Math and Science Academy, which is in Marlborough.

And, uh, I think, with, uh, when I got stuck some of those times, there were people to reach out to and to make it a little bit easier to go through some of those challenges.  Uh, whereas, like, it's a very different kind of learning for, like, learning in sport, if you just have to practice it until you get it.  And you can't really get anyone, or help to figure it out.

Um, there was never any effort to improve, or to understand how to improve.  And I think that made a huge difference at Olin.  It's just that, because there is an active effort to understand learning and education, an active effort to see how it works and how to improve it, that people really cared and focused on it.  Um, even if it's not making any progress, right, even if a survey or a study takes years and years and years to come to its conclusion, the fact that it's there is a big deal.

Those are things that normal organizers and designers don't bring to the table, you know, they just bring their taste and their processes there, and they're like, 'Okay, we'll do it this way.'

Now, I also see teaching, as a transference of knowledge that doesn't have to be complete.  We're such an Internet-based society now, that people don't necessarily know the specific fact, but they know exactly what words to type into, you know, a search engine to find that information.  Um, I appreciate that.  It's the same idea, I guess, as not learning and memorizing facts and formulas, it's an open-book test.  And I do that same thing at work.  I teach my coworkers to go look at resources that either exist from someone else's doing, or that I have produced, so that they don't constantly need to ask; um, they can go and seek for themselves.

Hmm.  About the way that you learn.  Um, differently about the way that you learn.  I did really, really poorly, um...okay.  That's an understatement.  In, in high school physics -- mechanics, specifically -- um, there just was so much to teach that they actually took a whole year just for mechanics, um, and then a whole year for E and M.  And, uh, and even then, they just, they mostly just taught, kind of, elementary ideas about how everything applied.  And then, based on this elementary idea, please, you know, just simply memorize this formula.  Um, and so I don't think I had a good concept of mechanics from high school, even though I did perfectly fine in the class, and I did perfectly fine on my AP exam.  

And then we come to a physics/mechanics, first semester, freshman year at Olin, and I still had this pretty crappy foundation, and I appreciated that they were still trying to help you understand, um, but I guess the way that a physicist comes at things just isn't how I learn.  Um, and they were still teaching it like a physics class.  They were still teaching it the way you teach it as a science.  You now, here's the scientific method.  We tested it.  Here's what we found, you know, based on refuting various hypotheses.  And here's the mathematical derivation as one of these axioms and laws.  Oh, okay.  It just...nothing was clicking for me.  

And then we did a mechanics class, my sophomore year.  And I learned more in the first two weeks of that class than I did in my full year and a half of mechanics previously.  This mechanics of solids and structures course, I think it was Doug Brooks teaching it, and damned if he didn't shove more information into my head in an awesome, effective, willing way, in just two weeks, than I had spent laboring for a year and a half.  Um, and so for the rest of that class, I felt like it was a slam-dunk.  I really, really got mechanics, and every time he brought up more of those laws and, um, formulas from physics class, I'm, like, 'Oh, I got this.  I got this.'  And it was all in the teaching and the application.  Um, really it was just...I don't even want to say it was hands-on, but it was so practical, and based in reality, that I just, I just got it.  *laughs*

I don't recall a specific experience.

And I would answer them, and they would still talk to the guys. And then, you know, at that point, my entire team started having conversations about gender because they were, like, 'Why would they not talk to Christine? Why can't they just talk to her?' I've gone to, um, technical, like, software start-up mixers and had, had a name badge and, and everything, like a normal attendee, and had people say, 'Oh, are you here with your boyfriend?'  Whereupon I would have to say, 'No, actually, I was a programmer.' Um, and then, because I worked in open source and so much of that is...

I thought that you were (1) a guy, (2) white, and (3) about 10 years older that you actually are.'  So, I'm going, 'Okay, why...'  And, and, and I had a really good reputation. I was quite well respected in those communities. And so, um, you know, I started wondering, 'If you saw me in person first, would you...would we have had the same level of initial respect? Why did you assume that I was a, you know, white man in my early thirties?  Because I was...was it because I was good and that's what you think good people look like?'

'I've been in a place in the world where it's not like this. This doesn't have to be normal. In fact, this is, this is really bad', instead of calibrating normal equals badness. It could get better, but normal equals badness. Normal for me was not perfect, but better, and so I was able to experience the negative gender, um, environment of the technical world as not normal.  Which is really helpful because when you see something as not normal, there's more of a hope for the person that it's going to change and that it's going to be different instead of being something they're just stuck with.

It's, um, I'm not, not doing a very good job of expressing this, but also look at other types of diversity involved at Olin, um, racial diversity, um, socio-economic diversity, in particular, and sometimes it feels a little bit like, 'We're really good at letting anybody from any demographic background fit into the behavioral box that has primarily been made by middle-class white men.'  Um, but expanding that behavioral box...so, so, like, you know, 'It doesn't matter that you're black, Latino...um, a black or Latino female who is lesbian and in a wheelchair or whatever.  We'll help you behave like a white guy.' Anyone can behave like a white guy, but there's, there's less diversity _____ [01:12:43].  What does an integrated sense of identity mean when you are in a minority demographic here and you become an engineer from within that instead of shovelling yourself into a middle-class, white, able-bodied, straight-sexed man box? And I wonder if that might be one of the reasons why the demographic make-up of Olin is the way it is, because it's the group of people who can fit themselves into that behavioral box and can recognize themselves as being able to fit into that behavioral box. That's a lot more self-confidence and a much bigger box than a lot of other engineering institutions that I've seen, but it's still there.

Everyone's philosophy on, kind of...nothing was competitive, right?  It was all about sharing ideas, sharing perspective, getting to something that would be beneficial for the entire group.  And that really appealed to me because I thought that's the best way that you can, um, I don't know, kind of absorb the most mind knowledge; versus other schools might have individual competitions or something.  Everyone's kind of in their own little bubble, doesn't want to share their secrets or what they know.  It's kind of the concept of, you know, the more mind you have, the smarter you are as a whole.

I think it, it struck me a little bit more, again in retrospect, um, after I went to go work for an engineering company, and I was the only, you know, 20-something female out of 40-some-odd male engineers there.  Which had some funny effects on dynamics.  Um, it also had some funny effects just on environment.  Like, working for that company, I would always have to bring my heavy winter coat to the office when it was 100 degrees outside, or take my laptop outside the stall every couple of hours, because I was working with all guys, who like to keep the temperature 62 degrees, or something.  Um, so it had some funny, odd, effects, and I think I may be appreciated the fact that it was more equally gender balanced when I came back to Olin after working for a heavily male company, but at Olin, you know, you didn't notice it as much.

Umm, let's see.  Hmm.  So, on gender and engineering, there's a slightly different context.  I had that interesting experience when I was at, worked on my MBA.  Because I was doing an MBA in technology commercialization, it was heavily, um, mid-career engineers that were going back for their MBA training.  Uh, so it was a little bit funny to have...which were...as many of them were male, predominantly male, when I was a 20-something female, thrown into the mix, working on MBA stuff.  Which, you know, I don't think it actually was a negative impact and didn't feel like that meant they'd listen to me any less, which is very typically what you'd expect.

So, like we do a lot of, like, even just on like, our Facebook page, or something, sharing of like of these articles like, studies about females and science, and like how these gender stereotypes are still there, and still like compose you to grow, um, which I think like is also becoming a more popular topic recently which I'm really happy about.  Um, I, I'm not really sure how much you can do except like spread awareness.  One of the reasons here that we do the downtown science project thing, um, is also in addition to like, helping the students in this area like, become more excited about science.  Like, it's also like, here we are like, female scientists, and engineers, and we're out here, and like, know that we exist, know that like, like if you are a girl you can do it too, or if you are a guy, and you see a girl doing science, it's not a weird thing, and it's not something that they can't do.  Um, I very strongly believe in, in making that happen because I think that like, I held back a little bit, um, in college because of this perception that I was like too stupid to be there, um, and, uh, I don't want girls to go through that.  Um, and I don't want anybody to go through that, and I think a lot of people at Olin actually struggle with the feeling that they don't think that they're smart enough to be there, that you definitely should not ever think it because of like your background, because that's like something that you can't help at all.  Um, and I think that...the hard thing is that I know that it's still holds me back a little bit.  Um, it's real easy to see like, studies of like, yeah you know, same resume, one girl name, one guy name, who do people think like are  more talented or skilled, like, the statistics will be like the guy, and I'm like, I don't know.

Um, I don't know.  I can't really pin point it.  I don't know how touchy mentioning specific people are. I know there's one professor at Olin that people generally say is kind of sexist and kind of a jerk.  Um, and I was sort of mindful of that, but I didn't, I don't think I particularly experienced it.  I think sometimes I wonder if, uh, professors are being nicer to me, especially when I fail at something, um, because I'm a girl, and because you have to use like, you know, your soft blows or something for girls.  Um, but I guess because, uh...I think the thing that's really hard with, maybe with discrimination, or something in general, is that you don't know if it's you, or is it the group that you belong to, and you also don't know if like, all the pressure, or extra difficulties that you feel are again, if they're just you, um, if they're imaginary, or if again, they belong to your group.  So, I do think that that's one of the difficulties.  Um, like, I think girls will often say like, uh, here's something.  Like, girls will often say like, yeah, no, like, you know, like my guy teammate is treating me totally fairly we did equal work, blah-blah-blah.  The girls are always the one's who like, who write out the reports, and  it takes a minute to do, who do have these like secretarial, organizational, um, making things look pretty roles, and less of the technical stuff, and I think that that was true of my Scope Project.    Um, and I don't think stuff like that is okay.  Um, but who truly plays a factor into that, if it's like, oh girls are not leaning in, which is a phrase I hate, but whatever, or, you know, if it's the environment.

All of them were giant institutional ships that would obviously not be turned.  All of them had really set student cultures which revolved around things that I may or may not be actually interested in, um, whether those be sports or fraternities.

Um, the faculty that I met at other schools cared very little about teaching.  It was shocking to me.

They weren't just biology; it was biology and art.  You know, it wasn't just engineering, it was engineering and design.  Olin really understood how to respect the whole person, the whole community, the whole school, um, in one integrated unit.  And I'm not even sure that engineering, at the very beginning, was, was fundamental to what Olin was doing, but, um, this concept of building a school that really tried to bring everything together, along with people who cared, I think that was a huge deal.

It's just that, because there is an active effort to understand learning and education, an active effort to see how it works and how to improve it, that people really cared and focused on it.

And that's virtually on me.  Um, but I also felt that it was partially - and this is, you know, where I felt like a lot of the boys that came in had already experienced some of that.  And for whatever reason - I don't know if that was just because they were passionate about it, they pursued it, or actually it kind of was presented to them as something they should do, or that wasn't presented to me.  

And not like...so I'm not quite sure about that, but I did feel like, coming into Olin, I didn't have some of the same experiences that, uh, some of the boys in my class had, and I felt, because Olin is so project oriented, that a lot of those projects where you had to work with a team, um, to meet a goal - which again, they have to do until it's done.  *laughs*  Um, where it had some kind of time constraint, um, because some of the, the boys had more experience in it, they were just going to fill those roles.

It was like we were telling, like, different experiences we had, what kinds of things we had done, the different projects, or whatever.  And we were kind of like, 'Oh,' you know, like, 'Oh, I worked on the, like, you know, how to make it pretty side of things.'

That was great.  And, you know, it was kind of one of the things that attracted me to Olin, because, you know, I was saying earlier, I didn't want that, like, stereotypical engineer.  And in I mind the stereotypical engineer is also male.  *laughs*  So just by having more girls, you're like, 'Alright, already not meeting the stereotype.'  So, uh, I think that was a really nice part about Olin, and that there were...you know, there were other women who were there in it with me, and I'm not the only one.  So, that was my point in sharing.

But even with that, I had no idea what engineering was, and even though I was in American Math and Science School, I wanted to be an art graphic design major.  Um, I told my parents this; they had serious objection to this idea and I thought, 'Well, then what do you want me to study?'  And they said, 'You're good at math and science; you should do engineering' and I didn't know what that was, but it was something they wanted me to study.  So, I looked into that and I realized that it made more sense than the other options that they told me that I could consider.  It was, 'Now that we are in America, you have four options for your career: medicine, law, business, or engineering - pick one.'  And engineering seemed to me like the most creative one and the closest I would be able to get to art, so, um, I started applying to engineering colleges and fortunately that ended up being a good fit.  But it was incredibly accidental.  I didn't choose engineering and I didn't get interested in engineering until I had already basically decided I was going to study engineering whether I was interested or not.

And I like being good at it, and generally, like, I am helping that family make the decisions they need to be able to make, versus just teaching them in a way that is not taking into account whether or not they're understanding it, if there's a better way to communicate that information, et cetera, which, unfortunately, happens all the time in medicine, where you see patients that have no...you know, someone says to themselves, _____  [00:47:01] the physician says to themselves that they taught the material, but they set it all in medical-ese, and the poor family has no idea what's going on and can't make good decisions. 

Um, so I enjoy being aware enough to feel like I'm doing a good job in helping the family to get to where they need to be.  Um, and somewhat similar, let's say, if I'm teaching, or I will eventually be teaching residents or medical students, um, sort of like I am teaching in a way, figuring out how to teach material in a way that is going to help them be able to help patients make decisions in a way that make sense.  So, I enjoy being the challenge, but also, hopefully, getting it right and that I'm teaching things effectively.

Um, and so I applied.  But it wasn't until I went to candidates' weekend, uh, and saw the school kind of having taken shape and with this community of really awesome people who were very passionate about things, that I knew that that was the only school I wanted to go to.

Um, so they only offered three at the time, mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and engineering with.  And at the time they...it was not common at all to design your own concentration, so they just had a couple of set concentrations.  Um, I mean, even at the time, E with design didn't exist yet.  Um, so I had actually already looked at doing the systems engineering program at a couple of other schools, even though I didn't 100 percent at the time still understand what systems engineering was.  Um, I looked at the mechanical engineering program, and it didn't really tickle my fancy, and I saw some of the classes that were in there, um, and one of them in particular, there was a certain teacher who taught it, and I noticed a lot of people were avoiding that class, and I was wondering if it was because this class was hard.  And when I asked about it, it turned out that everyone just hated that professor, and they had some issues with him in an honor board case.  So I was, like, oh, that sounds like, you know, situation I'd be happy to avoid.  

And I looked at E with electrical and computing engineering.  I love computing engineering.  Actually, I took several classes in computing at Olin, and I enjoyed all of them, um, but all the electrical engineering classes I took, I hated.  *laughs*  I really, really, really just don't care for circuit boards and...um, so I knew that that major wasn't for me.  Um, when it came to choosing an engineering concentration, I loved the flexibility of the E with concentration, because you basically got to choose half your core courses from the MechE line and half your core courses from the ECE line.  So it felt like I could really customize the degree to me, and I'd still get to take a Capstone class, which, uh, was with Doug...don't remember his last name.  And, uh, and I enjoyed the Capstone class.  I don't think it was a rigorous as it could have been, um, but, but it was nice to really delve into systems engineering at the undergraduate level.  A lot of school do try to reserve that for graduate class work.  Um, but I loved the way that it combines looking at the details with working with the big picture at the same time.  I loved the way that you get to translate technical terms between different types of engineers, and both of those are skills that I feel very strongly that I have been working to master, so, anyway, that's I picked E with systems.

Um, I first got the opportunity to take control of my education going into high school.  I was offered the opportunity to apply to either the math/science magnet, or the international baccalaureate program, or to stay in my normal home school.  

And, um, I ended up applying to both programs, and I realized, probably right after submitting the applications, that I actually had no interest in going to the math/science magnet.  Um, the more I learned about what they did there, the more I thought it sounded like that kind of, that black and white science mentality, or that memorizing all the math kind of stuff, and that you didn't get any kind of well-rounded education.  Um, and that scared the crap out of me.  I met some people who'd gone to those schools, and I thought they were kind of stuck-up and geeky, and it didn't strike me as normal.  Not that I've ever been normal, but anyway.  

So, I ended up choosing the international baccalaureate path, and I think that was brilliant.  Um, I still had the option to do advanced math, which I did.  I still had the option to do advanced science, which I actually, I did too, and I still had a very well-rounded education, which I appreciated.  Um, I got the option to choose my own school for college.  I think I chose very, very well.  I had the option to choose my own grad school.  I chose poorly.  Um, but I like how I did it.  I like that I chose an accelerated program.  I like that I did while employed full-time and making a salary.  I like that I didn't have to pay for my graduate degree.  All of those things are positives, so in my head, I let them over-run the fact that GW sucked.

And they said, 'You're good at math and science; you should do engineering' and I didn't know what that was, but it was something they wanted me to study.  So, I looked into that and I realized that it made more sense than the other options that they told me that I could consider.  It was, 'Now that we are in America, you have four options for your career: medicine, law, business, or engineering - pick one.'  And engineering seemed to me like the most creative one and the closest I would be able to get to art, so, um, I started applying to engineering colleges and fortunately that ended up being a good fit.  But it was incredibly accidental.  I didn't choose engineering and I didn't get interested in engineering until I had already basically decided I was going to study engineering whether I was interested or not.

So, um, I decided to apply and, um, my parents were actually not happy about that at all.  They originally forbade me to apply to Olin because it was new and not tested, and they wanted me to go to MIT or contract with Stanford or something.  Um, so Olin was the random grab bag that I sweet-talked my parents into.

You're right.  Yeah.  I...how do I say it, I think that part of what I struggled with, and actually I've been recently trying to make through is that I think part of it is just the venue of teaching for me.  Like, I definitely find reading with these kids a lot more satisfying than anything else that I've done.  Um, and I think, I don't know if it's guilt or something, but the part of it is that I really do know that in this area, it's a lot  different than the environment that I grew up in, and it's really easy for me to see now all these, uh, advantages, and like, ways that people helped me as I was a kid, and I feel like I'm really lucky to be where I am now, and so, I'm like, oh, I need to like, like I need to help out.  Like, I feel really happy that I received all these opportunities as a kid, and I think that like, that should be more available to kids.  Um, and the more that I do here, especially because I had, I had to teach, um, I had to TA for college classes, but then, sort of like aiding K through 12.  Like you can really see how it fills up, and how like, set backs early on, just like, gain momentum, and to like, larger set backs later on, but then, like how helping out a young age often can have such a propagating effect.  And so, like I think, like when you can see that picture more clearly, um, you see that there's like a real need to help out.  And so, I don't know, for me, I do, and I even feel bad for disliking it like, I should feel more fulfilled, which is why I'm trying to do a few different things that I thought maybe I could find the ones that I like more, and stick with those.  So, it should be something like, that I think is good, and morally satisfying, and also like, genuinely like pleasuring, like, as an individual...

But really, having different perspectives is how you can build your own, like, breadth, because you're always looking at something kind of like with horse blinders on; you're just only seeing kind of what's in front of you. 

But if you hear other people's experiences and different points of view, and, you know, get their insights on, 'This is how I feel,' like a woman in math and science, engineering, and all this stuff.

It's a lot more ... degrading or demeaning toward women, uh, when there are no women around whereas when there are, uh, it's a lot easier to be more respectful, and recognize women as people, um, which just being degrading or disrespectful to any particular group just feels unpleasant.  Um, and so, yeah.  That's, I don't know, one big reason.  So, yeah.  Having women around, to have real relationships with, and for, uh, I feel like it just ties the whole community together, um, to have both genders, and it's a pretty good balance.

I guess the way that a physicist comes at things just isn't how I learn.  Um, and they were still teaching it like a physics class.  They were still teaching it the way you teach it as a science.  You now, here's the scientific method.  We tested it.  Here's what we found, you know, based on refuting various hypotheses.  And here's the mathematical derivation as one of these axioms and laws.  Oh, okay.  It just...nothing was clicking for me.

There was something weird about how she was approaching all the material, and I really couldn't figure it out.  

And then, when she told me she was leaving, and kind of why she was leaving, it did help click for me that she and I learn very differently.  Um, she is a scientist at heart.  She sees things in black and white, and she, she doesn't approach things with a rule of thumb; she approaches things as a test, just like the scientific method.  Um, she guesses at something, a hypothesis, and then she kind of goes through and tests it, and if she's wrong, she tried adjusting.  And she likes using control cases and, um, she doesn't like guessing.  It's just not her thing.  Um, she doesn't like things that are fuzzy, or shades of gray.  That's always been my thing.  I love rules of thumb.  I love shades of gray.  Um, I don't see things as inherently one way or the other.  I see all the different contexts in which they might change slightly, or they might be interpreted differently, or various external factors may change, and all of a sudden you see it, you know, veering a different way.  Um, that's always been my thing, even since I was little.  

Um, and so, to me, that mentality is how engineers often think.  They're sitting there, they see all these different little variables, and they're trying to optimize.  Okay, which is the way the bridge will be strongest but still cheap, and won't fall down?  You know, which is the way that , um, my solar car will have sufficient battery power but won't be so heavy that it can't actually roll?  Um, to me, those are the fun parts, and to her, they paralyzed her.  She could not make a decision that wasn't obviously the right, correct solution.  Um, and that's been always a big thing to me.  Um, I always know that if I'm trying to do a proof, for example, of those mechanics formulas, I'm going to get it wrong.  I'm going to mess up somewhere, and then you can't finish your proof, because it won't be right.  Math has, in many cases, a correct way and a wrong way, and if you mess up some little thing, you won't finish to the end.

But at Olin, people had different interests, but they, I guess, just manifested those differently, because we all had in common that we were, you know, math and science type minded people, and, you know, we were all interested in engineering, but within that, we all had our own unique, uh, passions as well.

Honestly, I thought, when I thought 'engineer,' I thought of a train engineer, so I wasn't, you know, one of those who was involved in robotics or, um, you know, any other type of lab stuff.  I was just good in math and science and liked to solve problems.

And, I would take the time and effort _____ [00:01:37] education, or like at school and high school.  Um, I would want to do my homework as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible so that I could get an A, but also so that I could go hang out with my friends afterwards.  And, so, with this teacher, I had a class with her early on, and I wanted to prove that I could, you know, be good, and literally the first day of school, I would stay after her classroom for two hours and finish all my homework, ask all my questions about her class - this was, like, chem honors, I think - and, you know, she was, I guess, impressed by that.  And then I wanted to keep feeding the grad part, and she was really the only person through my adolescent life that was kind of feeding me.  You know, 'Hey, you're really good at this stuff.

And then, on my part, um, my expectations for myself as a student, as a learner going through a learning environment, um, they're all, they're all affective, so I expect myself to be conscious of and monitoring my internal state, not just the cognitive structure of the, um, like, the concept map of what I'm learning, but also am I, am I tired, am I getting frustrated at this, am I being open-minded, am I being really stubborn, am I withdrawing from contact with other people because I'm, I'm embarrassed that my cord doesn't work yet or whatever.  And so, I have a lot of expectations for myself in, in that space of, like, emotions and internal space and keeping a certain kind of openness and hence self-reflexivity.  Um, and that for me is very, very, very, very more important than learning how to do just the program I work with, because I've found that if I focus too hard on my content goals, I usually don't make them and I'm miserable, but if I focus on my personal state as a learner and I'm making sure that my teachers are supporting me in keeping that state open, then I learn a lot of content as a side effect.

So, um, the stuff that depends on lectures, like many pop quizzes and stuff, can I not do them and, you know, do a small project or write a paper instead on the same topic to demonstrate that I've learned the material?

Codes:  [environment expectations]

So, one thing that I don't think that Olin does particularly well yet in terms of gender and teaching and learning engineering education is we are gender-wise, number-wise diverse, but I don't think that there's a lot of thought or a lot of space to look at more what it means to be a woman in engineering. We are able to be woman engineers, but I don't, I don't know how many people go, 'How...' _____ [01:11:33] but, like, 'How does my gender or how does these other parts of my identity affect the way I might form my engineering identity?  It's, um, I'm not, not doing a very good job of expressing this, but also look at other types of diversity involved at Olin, um, racial diversity, um, socio-economic diversity, in particular, and sometimes it feels a little bit like, 'We're really good at letting anybody from any demographic background fit into the behavioral box that has primarily been made by middle-class white men.'  Um, but expanding that behavioral box...so, so, like, you know, 'It doesn't matter that you're black, Latino...um, a black or Latino female who is lesbian and in a wheelchair or whatever.  We'll help you behave like a white guy.' Anyone can behave like a white guy, but there's, there's less diversity _____ [01:12:43].  What does an integrated sense of identity mean when you are in a minority demographic here and you become an engineer from within that instead of shovelling yourself into a middle-class, white, able-bodied, straight-sexed man box? And I wonder if that might be one of the reasons why the demographic make-up of Olin is the way it is, because it's the group of people who can fit themselves into that behavioral box and can recognize themselves as being able to fit into that behavioral box. That's a lot more self-confidence and a much bigger box than a lot of other engineering institutions that I've seen, but it's still there.  So, yeah.  So, I, I, I feel like that's an area for future improvement at Olin somewhere, in, in everybody's copious amounts of free time.

So I certainly appreciated that it was, that it wasn't the vast majority, but I think maybe because it wasn't the vast majority, most of the time, it didn't...I hadn't known...I hadn't ever worked or been anywhere in an engineering setting where I was the minority, so it didn't strike me as so unusual.

Um, if I were to go back to, or whenever I go back to school, um, I guess I'll have more of an expectation of, uh, a dialogue of being able to, uh, have questions answered, and have that sort of freedom for exploration, um, it also sort of underscores the difference between like a 15-person classroom, and a, you know, like a lecture hall full of a 100, or 200 people, that 15 or 20-person classroom, you can have an individual conversation with almost everyone in the room even if it's just a few minutes for each student.  Um, a couple hundred people in a lecture hall, it's a one way conversation for the most part.  Um, you can occasionally take questions from a few students, but it's usually gonna be the same student over and over again.  They're usually gonna be kind of clarifying anything you've glaringly missed, but, um, yeah.  It's just not the same.  It's not a super beneficial environment I think for learning the sort of things that I want to learn.  I have an expectation of, uh, yeah, that two way conversation, and that whole guided exploration thing.

They weren't cultures that wanted to do something different and better for the world, and they weren't cultures where students were there to really interact with other students and, and have great relationships.  

Um, the faculty that I met at other schools cared very little about teaching.  It was shocking to me.  Um, and the faculty I met at Olin were so very vocal in their passion for their subjects, and their subjects weren't just, you know, math; they were math and something else.  They weren't just biology; it was biology and art.  You know, it wasn't just engineering, it was engineering and design.  Olin really understood how to respect the whole person, the whole community, the whole school, um, in one integrated unit.  And I'm not even sure that engineering, at the very beginning, was, was fundamental to what Olin was doing, but, um, this concept of building a school that really tried to bring everything together, along with people who cared, I think that was a huge deal.  Um, I wish I saw that in the Olin culture today, but, um, I really don't want to make too many judgments, because I'm only so connected; you know, more disconnected than connected with Olin today.

Um, the first one that comes to mind is my learning experience that was my grad degree.  I got my MF from the George Washington University, GW, which is, uh, they've got a good reputation, definitely one of the most expensive master's degrees in the country.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.  And, uh, they have a whole school for science and applied...sorry, engineering and applied sciences, so I thought I was, you know, golden for my grad degree.  And I showed up to do classes, um, and I was really excited because I got a cohort education.  It was me and the same 20 people that went from start to finish together, um, for all of our classes.  

Um, so, in that sense, to me it was...I knew it would feel a little bit like Olin.  And yet at the same time, I think my graduate program was almost the opposite of Olin in, in almost every way it could be.  Um, the teachers couldn't give a crap.  The school couldn't give a crap.  You were nothing to them but a wallet.  Um, the curriculum really did no justice to the subject matter, from my perspective.  Um, and the syllabi of the classes were not designed to teach.  They were designed to convey whatever material they wanted to test, um, in your exam or your project or your paper.  And, to me that was just a travesty of education.

P10: 01-30-15-1 - Greg.rtf - 10:31 [Yeah. Okay. That's an interest..]  (257:257)   (Super)
Codes:  [environment expectations]

Yeah.  Okay.  That's an interesting question.  Um, well, so currently I'm taking a Spanish class at one of the local universities, it's like a continuing education program for adults.  Um, one thing that frustrates me about it is that, um, it's not exactly the level course I want to take.  I kind of want it to be a little more of an intensive program.  So, I think what that tells me abo...is that my expectation when I go into a program or a class is that, um, it's like need to be tailored to my current skill level.  Um, now, I don't think that that's a realistic expectation, but that is an expectation that I guess I have subconsciously.  Uh, the other thing is that from my myself when it does not...when the class is not neat and tailored to my ability, um, I then say well I have to make this useful somehow _____ [00:27:49] paid money for it.  Um, and, so, I end up, uh, doing what I think I've done in the past which is, you know, use the class for what you can so figure out quickly what information you can get and what you can benefit from and then, uh, take the rest of the time that you're in there however you want to modify or hack the learning experience to, um, expand your knowledge otherwise.  So, for example, if I feel like paying attention 100% of the time in class it's going to be too low information density for me then I'll, you know, pay attention in times that I think are useful and then the rest of the time I'll work on coming up with my own curriculum, you know, so I'll try to translate sentences on my own or write a composition on my own and look up words in the dictionary so that I can further, you know, the composition that I'm working on and that is helpful.  So, I guess that expectation is more _____ [00:28:57] as, um, one, an expectation that the learning environment suits me and two, an expectation for myself that to the _____ [00:29:10] environment does not suit me to put in some amount of effort to maximize the efficiency of the time, uh, so I can learn as much as possible.

I did only apply to engineering programs.  It's kind of funny, because the whole time I was applying to colleges, I was, like, I don't want to end up somewhere where there's just engineers.  So _____ [00:01:54] stopped at Olin, uh, but Olin was kind of a different kind of engineer, and I guess I had in my mind, you know, the stereotypical engineer.  So, uh, it kind of, it kind of fit with what I was thinking.  You know, just that, oh, it's different.  Like, _____ [00:02:13] people were, not only had different interests, but, uh, maybe some things more in common than we all were, you know, studying engineering.  But, uh, I applied to 10 different schools _____ [00:02:23] kind of all over the east coast.  Um, I did not apply to MIT; that was kind of in that too-engineering type of world for me.  But, I applied to Olin.  *laughs*  So, you never know.

Codes:  [environment expectations] [learning goals]

Sure.  Um, so, I mean, learning before Olin was generally easier.  You know, I kind of...I call it, a little bit, gaming the system.  Like, I knew what, what was expected in high school, and I knew how to achieve it.  And then, uh, like Olin had this different set of expectations, uh, and, you know, it was kind of you're working till the dark and maybe you have to stay up every night forever, that you have to stay up every night forever.  Whereas in high school, you could kind of get away with, well, 'We worked, you know, only this number of hours,' and, 'I tried this, you know; I don't get it,' or whatever. 

But I also never felt that, uh, I hit the wall in a kind of way with some of the projects I had at Olin, where, you know, like in high school, I feel like, I felt like I kind of...you know, I knew what to do and I knew how to figure it out, and, uh, I also had my parents.  My parents were around if I messed up, and they were very willing to help out.  Um, and then at Olin, you're kind of like, you're on your own in a different kind of way, and I think you figure that out.  Like, 'Whoa.  I have to figure out, like, who do I talk to if I get stuck?' and 'How do I think about this thing?' Or, you know, 'If I just have to get this thing done, I have to stay up until it's done,' or, you know, God forbid if something goes wrong with the code at the last hour, and you have to stay up until it's fixed.  Like, you can't really just say, like, you know, 'Oh, well, I tried.'  So, it's a different kind of experience in that way.

So, like why not, why not help them out, and learn a little something for myself at the same time.  Um, I do think that, um, most students at Olin are really interested in a lot of different things.  Uh, they work hard on a lot of projects that aren't even class related, and so, even if you don't have something, it's still easy to find someone who does, and just sort of like, join in on that.

Um, so it's...like, I had an excellent faculty member first semester who was teaching, um, a class with, um, over 200 students so it wasn't, wasn't certainly the degree of interaction that you can get in an Olin-sized classroom, but he still managed, um, that quite well, in my opinion.

I think I'm to some extent relearning, now that I'm back in school, um, is, like, how to engage with faculty differently.  Um, there are some people where, like, I need to go to every office hours to make sure that, like, I'm following everything, um, and other faculty and other classes where, um, like, it's most important for me to sort of pour time into projects or, like, get as much, um, sort of hands-on experience as possible, others where, um, it's most helpful for me to, like, do as wide reading as I can.  Um, so, I think that, um, I've certainly...I don't approach every class the same way and I think that's, um, informed somewhat by, um, my understanding of both the faculty's teaching style and the class content structure.

And, so, with this teacher, I had a class with her early on, and I wanted to prove that I could, you know, be good, and literally the first day of school, I would stay after her classroom for two hours and finish all my homework, ask all my questions about her class - this was, like, chem honors, I think - and, you know, she was, I guess, impressed by that.  And then I wanted to keep feeding the grad part, and she was really the only person through my adolescent life that was kind of feeding me.  You know, 'Hey, you're really good at this stuff.  You can, you know, be a great person in math and science and engineering and whatnot.'  So, that was kind of most of the encouragement from her.

Um, you know, trying to always get a better knowledge base.  But, you know, at that point I was already pretty, like in terms of changing my path, I was already going down that path.  He just kind of accelerated it a little bit more.  But Mrs. Kim , who was my high school teacher, she was the one that really put me onto this path, the better path.

Um, I had, like, one experience with a professor where I was, like...I think he was sexist.  And, like...

I: Can you tell me more about that?

P: Um...

I: That was one of my next questions, anyway.

P: *laughs* Um, he...it was in my sophomore year in the fall, um, sort of before I was declaring major but, like, I was interested in physics and so I thought that was maybe the direction I was going to go.  Um, and he was teaching me modern physics and so I thought, like, 'Oh, you're my physics teacher.  I'm thinking about declaring physics.  You'd be, like, a reasonable person to talk to about this...'

I: Hmm, hmm.
[01:12:32]
P: And so, I set up an appointment with him.  He told me to, like, come to office hours, and I told him that, and he told me not to major in physics.  Um, I think his, his actual words, as I remember them, are, 'Physics isn't a very interesting field right now,' um, and said that I shouldn't do it.  And then, like, a week later, I was in class one day and I was, like, I was pretty early to class because, like, no one else was there yet but he was, um, and all of a sudden he was, like, 'Yeah.  Like, you should major in physics.  Like, I think, like, you really have a gift for it.  Like, you should do it.'  Um, and I realized that that was... between those two times, he had graded out first tests, which meant it was the first time he'd ever actually seen my work...

I: Okay.

P: In a physics class, so it was...like, it was clear to me, or at least it was my interpretation of those events that, like, he had thought I wasn't good at physics.  Like, he, he thought I was dumb...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: And, like, like, there were a lot of times in class when I would, like, ask questions because...like, a lot of the material in the class wasn't new to me at that point and I was, like, disappointed that he wasn't going into more depth.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Like, I had expected it to be in more depth, and it wasn't.  And so, I'd ask questions that tried to get at that a little bit, like, dig a little deeper than what he was telling us, and he would never answer them.  Like, he would always...his response was always to, like, to...he would just say...he would repeat whatever he had said immediately before I asked the question and, like, with a tone that I interpreted as, like, 'I already told you this.  Why don't you get it?'
[01:14:30]
I: Hmm, hmm.

P: When, like, in reality what he was saying was, like, not an answer to the question I had asked.  Um, so, like, between that and the, like, 'Physics isn't interesting' when, like, 'Your career is physics!' *laughs*  Um, I interpreted it as, like, he thought I was no good at physics and so he was telling me not to do it.  And then he saw my test, which I had aced because I was good at physics, and he was, like, 'Oh, just kidding!  You should be a physicist now.'  And that was, like...it was already, like, too late at that point.  I was just, like, 'I, I don't care what you think and I just, like, kind of hate you!'  *laughs*  Um...

I: So, is there anything that happened that led you to believe that those interactions were based on gender?

P: Um, I don't really know.  Like, I didn't...like, that was part of it also.  Like, I never really, like, told other people or, like, professors or, like...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: People...I never told anyone other than students, at least not for a couple of years, about this because, um, like, I...no, like, I don't have proof that it was about gender but, like...

I: Right.

P: I got the impression that it was and, like, it...just looking at, like, the other...the impression...like, just, like, the ways he interacted with, like, other students in the class and that he, like...

I: Okay.
[01:15:50]
P: He was generally clear about who he thought was intelligent and who he thought wasn't.  And, like, it seemed to fall...like, it wasn't a hundred percent, right?  Like, he did think I was smart after that first test, right...

I: Okay.

P: So, it wasn't, like, he never thought a girl was smart, but it did seem to, like, follow a general pattern where it was easier to be smart if you were a guy.

I: Okay.  I get you.  I, I wasn't sure at first from the way you were telling the story, that's all.

P: Yeah.

I: Yeah.

P: Um, but that was...like, going back to your question about how gender affected me at Olin, like, that was one experience and, like, it still upsets me.  Like, I'm still mad about it.

Um, and I was sort of mindful of that, but I didn't, I don't think I particularly experienced it.

They were hopefully kind of the appropriate level of challenge, where they could do and felt like they were succeeding in doing something that was more, that was more than what was expected of them.  Um, and I think they liked feeling like they were being, that they were being accomplished doing something that was extra-challenging.

Um, hmm.  Well, it all...it depends on the setting.  Like, when I'm teaching my...when I'm teaching patients, I...there's lots of different purposes to the teaching, so if I'm helping a family understand a really bad prognosis in their little one, then I'm not sure if 'intuitive' is quite the word, but it sort of is, in that I want to have the ability to teach it in a way that they can understand, they can process, they can make the best decision on behalf of their child.  And I like being good at it, and generally, like, I am helping that family make the decisions they need to be able to make, versus just teaching them in a way that is not taking into account whether or not they're understanding it, if there's a better way to communicate that information, et cetera, which, unfortunately, happens all the time in medicine, where you see patients that have no...you know, someone says to themselves, _____  [00:47:01] the physician says to themselves that they taught the material, but they set it all in medical-ese, and the poor family has no idea what's going on and can't make good decisions. 

Um, so I enjoy being aware enough to feel like I'm doing a good job in helping the family to get to where they need to be.  Um, and somewhat similar, let's say, if I'm teaching, or I will eventually be teaching residents or medical students, um, sort of like I am teaching in a way, figuring out how to teach material in a way that is going to help them be able to help patients make decisions in a way that make sense.  So, I enjoy being the challenge, but also, hopefully, getting it right and that I'm teaching things effectively.

Hmm, lots of reasons.  Um, I think the biggest one though is probably that, um, I really like the, uh, sort of novelty value, and the steep part of the learning curve getting used to a whole new discipline, and then, when I can see where a discipline is going I lose interest, and also, you know, once the work gets harder, and the sort of, um, feeling of how much new stuff I'm learning per amount of work that I'm putting in, uh, yeah, it drops.  Then, um, it becomes less interesting.  So, I sort of took early on a little bit of mechanical, a little bit of electrical, uh, a whole bunch of different, um, chemistry and material science, and just a bunch of different things, and I definitely could have still graduated, uh, mechanical, or electrical when I made that decision, but, um, the idea of continuing to just branch out and learn a bunch of different things, and then, tie it together somewhere toward the end where's, uh, it seemed both easy and inspiring.  So, yeah.

It's just new everyday, it's new every minute.  Uh, there's always something different going on.  Uh, I have a lot of questions that I don't know the answers to, um, I'm learning all the time, um, and I don't even really, like, that's not something that I think about while it's happening, or even necessarily when I get home, but in moments like this, and I look back over the last, you know, week or two, wow, I've learned way more in the last week or two than I do when I'm in school than I do, uh, pretty much anytime.  So, it's one of the most fast paced learning environments just in order to be a good teacher.  Uh, and I imagine you could get away without learning much as a teacher, just learn how to do it, and keep doing the same thing over, and over again, but this particular environment where I'm in at the moment, um, the school, uh, the curriculum's new every year, projects change, uh, it's always fast paced and changing, and then, at the moment too, I also do a lot of tool usage, and tool proficiency.  Like teaching, teaching how to do a lot of the things that I have just sort of made up, and figured out for myself over the years.  Uh, a good example of that is, uh, well, figuring out for myself while being instructed on every once in a while, um, but often by my dad, or often by, uh, a friend of my dad's, something like that.  Not anything in sort of an official learning capacity.  Like soldering, that I learned from my dad's friend, or like, um, you know, using a screw driver.  Um, it's not...I don't even remember if my parents' instructed me on it, or if I just started doing it, or...I'm sure they helped at some point.  Um, but I saw so young, that was a long, long time ago, um, and so, helping with that process, and figuring out what are the common, and uncommon sort of misconceptions, or, um, where the advancements are just so that I can sort of give it to someone, um, in order to help them learn other things.  In that particular case, uh, letting someone fail for a just a second so that, you know, screwing a screw, and then showing them that if you put force behind the screwdriver, and the tip of it stays in the screw, that's a huge moment of realization that I get to have a couple of hundred times a year, or at least 60 times a year.   Um, and it's really empowering.  I love empowering kids, but just people in general, but I feel like it's even easier with kids.

Um, and I think too, um, beyond that, I think that it's not in a very safe area, I guess  so, when we have, a lot of clubs come together to do, uh, that downtown thing every month, um, when we have that activity going on, and, um, it's also a safer environment.  I think that, that can help on a lot of levels too of like kids, like feeling okay to go outside, and explore things.  Not necessarily like science, or even traditional learning, uh, I don't know.

But through most of my first year, if you talked with me and said, 'What do you think of yourself as?', I would still be so...I would probably say, 'I guess an engineer' because that's what I knew I'd signed up for, and if you were one of my, if you were one of my teachers and asked me, I'd probably say engineering.  But if you were one of my friends and you asked me, I would say, 'I'm an artist who happens to be studying engineering right now.'  So, that, that project was for me a pretty large part of a transition between, 'I am somebody who is an engineering major for a whole bunch of reasons, um, but the reasons do not necessarily include ‘I identify as being an engineer'', um, to, 'Actually, I, I am still all these other things, um, I still consider myself an artist and so forth, but now I also see myself as having an engineering identity, and I really like this.'

I don't know.  I don't know how else to, like, categorize it, but that's...I get way more happiness from that than doing anything at work or doing, you know, any other random activity, um, you know, like sports or just any other, like, hobby or something.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and then they played a bunch of rounds of these games and it sort of showed them...like, we, we redistributed the water and the food in different ways to show how, like, how competition could happen if, like, water was really scarce or if, like, water and food were really far away for some reason...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and we introduced...like, we had half the students be one kind of animal and half the students be another so that, like, they were eating different kinds of food, and so, sometimes they were competing and sometimes they were not.

Like, when I give them a task that's, like, open ended and they come up with, like, all these different ways to solve it that, like, I hadn't even thought of.  Um, so, like, I can give you an example.  We did a project at the start of the second semester in the class that I was teaching this past year.  Um, I told students we were making mousetrap cars, and so...that's like a, a thing that exists, a fairly common project, like, there's a canonical way of doing it.  Um, but I didn't tell them that.  I...what I told them was, 'You're going to build a car and it needs to be powered by a mousetrap and you need to, like, know where the car is going to stop.  Like, you need to be able to predict that, how far it's going to go.'  Um, and that was it.  That was all of the instructions I gave them.  And then I just, like, put them in teams and said, 'Make something.'  Um, and a lot of them, when I introduced it, were, like, 'What?  Like, what are you talking about?  How can we possibly do that?'  But then, like, they came up with, like, really cool things.  Like, some of them did kind of, like, the typical, like, um, tie a string around the axle and, like, set it...attach it to the part of the mousetrap that moves when you release it.  Um, but then, like, one group created this thing where it only had two wheels and the whole car rotated.  Like, there was two wheels and then this piece of foam core between the two wheels that was...like, the length of the sides was less than the diameter of the wheels, so as the wheels rolled, the whole piece would just roll with it.  Um, and they would kind of, like, lightly get the car rolling forward such that it would...as it was rolling, it would then hit the mousetrap, like, something attached to the bottom of the car would hit the mousetrap, which would set it off and it would, like, go rocketing forward a lot faster.  And I was just, like, 'I never would have thought of that in a million years.  That is, like, so cool!'  *laughs*  And, like, there were other things like that.  Like, there were a lot of...there were, like, nine groups and nine very different designs in my class.  And so, just, like, seeing students come up with things like that is, like, always, like, really fun for me.

Um, you know, for instance, biology in high school, I loved it.  I thought AP biology was the best thing ever.  I ended up teaching, tutoring most of my AP class through their exam, because I really loved it, and they were glad that I liked it, and they put up with it.

So, it's one of the most fast paced learning environments just in order to be a good teacher.  Uh, and I imagine you could get away without learning much as a teacher, just learn how to do it, and keep doing the same thing over, and over again, but this particular environment where I'm in at the moment, um, the school, uh, the curriculum's new every year, projects change, uh, it's always fast paced and changing, and then, at the moment too, I also do a lot of tool usage, and tool proficiency.  Like teaching, teaching how to do a lot of the things that I have just sort of made up, and figured out for myself over the years.  Uh, a good example of that is, uh, well, figuring out for myself while being instructed on every once in a while, um, but often by my dad, or often by, uh, a friend of my dad's, something like that.  Not anything in sort of an official learning capacity.  Like soldering, that I learned from my dad's friend, or like, um, you know, using a screw driver.  Um, it's not...I don't even remember if my parents' instructed me on it, or if I just started doing it, or...I'm sure they helped at some point.  Um, but I saw so young, that was a long, long time ago, um, and so, helping with that process, and figuring out what are the common, and uncommon sort of misconceptions, or, um, where the advancements are just so that I can sort of give it to someone, um, in order to help them learn other things.  In that particular case, uh, letting someone fail for a just a second so that, you know, screwing a screw, and then showing them that if you put force behind the screwdriver, and the tip of it stays in the screw, that's a huge moment of realization that I get to have a couple of hundred times a year, or at least 60 times a year.   Um, and it's really empowering.  I love empowering kids, but just people in general, but I feel like it's even easier with kids.

Its intro chemistry...they're gonna be like, I don't know.  Um, there's so many things that I think that I think mix into my frustration.  Like, it's hard to separate out what they are, I think Olin added a really good enriching environment, that's rare in most universities.  I mean, I remember talking to most of my friends from high school, and telling them about my classes, and them telling me, and like, the classes I experienced here are like, very much, like what everybody else described to me.

What does an integrated sense of identity mean when you are in a minority demographic here and you become an engineer from within that instead of shovelling yourself into a middle-class, white, able-bodied, straight-sexed man box? And I wonder if that might be one of the reasons why the demographic make-up of Olin is the way it is, because it's the group of people who can fit themselves into that behavioral box and can recognize themselves as being able to fit into that behavioral box. That's a lot more self-confidence and a much bigger box than a lot of other engineering institutions that I've seen, but it's still there.

So, having some sort of a, you know, unique perspective and being able to make change in a small institution was definitely, you know, something that appealed to me, and having, like, smaller class sizes and whatnot.

So, really, it was like a...I mean, it was an internal, like, 'you can do it' thing, but also, the people at Olin were just so great and encouraging.  Um, you know, all of my classmates and all of the professors just want you to be the best 'you' possible.  So I think, getting that encouragement, I felt like I couldn't leave Olin, because then I'd be leaving these people who really, truly want the best for me.

Or, you know, 'If I just have to get this thing done, I have to stay up until it's done,' or, you know, God forbid if something goes wrong with the code at the last hour, and you have to stay up until it's fixed.  Like, you can't really just say, like, you know, 'Oh, well, I tried.'  So, it's a different kind of experience in that way.

Codes:  [feeling of value] [identity]

But then, um, the morning of expo, about, you know, an hour before we had to demo, it started working consistently, and then people were coming in, and the kids were playing with our project and it still worked, and I, I remember having this overwhelming sense of pride that I had been...I don't know, I had made this, that this thing that six months ago I wouldn't even begin to understand not just how it worked but also how I would even begin to learn how to understand how it worked, let alone how to make it.  Um, and then, sort of from that pride of having finished it, I thought back through the process and, and realized, 'You know, I actually really like the process, not just the end result. I liked coming to the point of this; it's that the journey and the destination are both very worthwhile.'  And I think that was the first time that I actually felt like I was an engineer and also that I liked engineering as opposed to enjoying being at Olin and studying engineering, which is, which is a subtly different thing.

Um, yeah, before that, I really liked being at Olin, my, you know, teachers were great, my classmates were great, and I liked taking engineering classes, or at least I didn't dislike taking engineering classes.  It was...I was having fun.  But through most of my first year, if you talked with me and said, 'What do you think of yourself as?', I would still be so...I would probably say, 'I guess an engineer' because that's what I knew I'd signed up for, and if you were one of my, if you were one of my teachers and asked me, I'd probably say engineering.  But if you were one of my friends and you asked me, I would say, 'I'm an artist who happens to be studying engineering right now.'  So, that, that project was for me a pretty large part of a transition between, 'I am somebody who is an engineering major for a whole bunch of reasons, um, but the reasons do not necessarily include ‘I identify as being an engineer'', um, to, 'Actually, I, I am still all these other things, um, I still consider myself an artist and so forth, but now I also see myself as having an engineering identity, and I really like this.'

'How does my gender or how does these other parts of my identity affect the way I might form my engineering identity?  It's, um, I'm not, not doing a very good job of expressing this, but also look at other types of diversity involved at Olin, um, racial diversity, um, socio-economic diversity, in particular, and sometimes it feels a little bit like, 'We're really good at letting anybody from any demographic background fit into the behavioral box that has primarily been made by middle-class white men.'  Um, but expanding that behavioral box...so, so, like, you know, 'It doesn't matter that you're black, Latino...um, a black or Latino female who is lesbian and in a wheelchair or whatever.  We'll help you behave like a white guy.' Anyone can behave like a white guy, but there's, there's less diversity _____ [01:12:43].  What does an integrated sense of identity mean when you are in a minority demographic here and you become an engineer from within that instead of shovelling yourself into a middle-class, white, able-bodied, straight-sexed man box? And I wonder if that might be one of the reasons why the demographic make-up of Olin is the way it is, because it's the group of people who can fit themselves into that behavioral box and can recognize themselves as being able to fit into that behavioral box. That's a lot more self-confidence and a much bigger box than a lot of other engineering institutions that I've seen, but it's still there.

It's kind of like, you know, don't put something that's somewhat rare - I don't know if it's really rare, but if it's rarer than not, um, to waste.  Then you, like, you should be doing it.  It's not like, uh, an external factor, where anyone's telling me, like, hey, you should be doing these things.

I don't know.

If it's a more traditional, lecture-based learning experience, I definitely have some expectation that the teacher has pre-thought about the best or most or at least an effective way to communicate the information.

Um, and the syllabi of the classes were not designed to teach.  They were designed to convey whatever material they wanted to test, um, in your exam or your project or your paper.  And, to me that was just a travesty of education.  

Um, and so I employed a skill that I learned at Olin in sophomore year, which was:  Learn for the learning.  Learn to understand and appreciate the material, and the grade will follow.  Um, now at Olin, sometimes that was problematic, because I would learn the material in the semester, and I'd get, you know, a C, and everything would click, you know, a semester later, after you had already taken the class.  *laughs*  And I'd start getting A's in that specific topic, and you're like, 'Ah, I wish I had quit a semester ago.'  But, um, but in grad school, you know, I learned for the sake of learning, because my teachers couldn't give a crap, and half the students couldn't give a crap, and I really just appreciated the material, and I dove into my projects in a way that I felt like I was getting value out of it, and I think that really showed.  

Um, we had a lot of students who were getting B's, which is not a great grade in a grad program, and we had a couple of students who were getting C's, which is a failing grade in a grad program, and, you know, I just sat there getting A after A after A.  I'm, like, well I must be doing something right, because I don't even think I'm testing super well.  Um, but you know, I really felt like I pulled a lot out of my graduate education.  And it's not something that was taught to me, it's not something they made any effort to convey, but I made the most of it,  because Olin helped me understand that learning is important.

There was something wrong in the timing of our circuit, um, so that it pushed the projectile forward and then back again, instead of out faster and faster.  *laughs*  But none of us cared, and we weren't graded on that fact.

Sure.  Um, so, I mean, learning before Olin was generally easier.  You know, I kind of...I call it, a little bit, gaming the system.  Like, I knew what, what was expected in high school, and I knew how to achieve it.  And then, uh, like Olin had this different set of expectations, uh, and, you know, it was kind of you're working till the dark and maybe you have to stay up every night forever, that you have to stay up every night forever.  Whereas in high school, you could kind of get away with, well, 'We worked, you know, only this number of hours,' and, 'I tried this, you know; I don't get it,' or whatever. 

But I also never felt that, uh, I hit the wall in a kind of way with some of the projects I had at Olin, where, you know, like in high school, I feel like, I felt like I kind of...you know, I knew what to do and I knew how to figure it out, and, uh, I also had my parents.  My parents were around if I messed up, and they were very willing to help out.  Um, and then at Olin, you're kind of like, you're on your own in a different kind of way, and I think you figure that out.  Like, 'Whoa.  I have to figure out, like, who do I talk to if I get stuck?' and 'How do I think about this thing?' Or, you know, 'If I just have to get this thing done, I have to stay up until it's done,' or, you know, God forbid if something goes wrong with the code at the last hour, and you have to stay up until it's fixed.  Like, you can't really just say, like, you know, 'Oh, well, I tried.'  So, it's a different kind of experience in that way.

Where, like, I didn't feel I had the opportunity to fill some of those roles, because I hadn't had prior experience in some of those things.

And that's what we did every week, all week, for my first two years of medical school, was basically assign each other to go learn about topics and come back and teach each other about everything you need to know in medical school.  

And, at the time I realized that that was useful, um, but I don't think I realized how much it was useful until I got on to, into clinical practice, where most of the time it would be, 'Okay, we have a 9-year-old presenting with this thing that's super-rare.'  No one on the team, you know, can remember precisely what the odds of this rare thing is and what's its pathology is, but I spent the last two years being able to rapidly go research something and teach it to a group.  Well, turns out that's what real clinical practice is.  So I go home, go research whatever a new patient is presenting with, and be able to teach it to my clinical group the next day.  Um, so I think in retrospect, the fact that my entire first two years was all team-based individual and peer teaching was incredibly influential.  But at the time it was just, that's what we do.

It's just new everyday, it's new every minute.  Uh, there's always something different going on.  Uh, I have a lot of questions that I don't know the answers to, um, I'm learning all the time, um, and I don't even really, like, that's not something that I think about while it's happening, or even necessarily when I get home, but in moments like this, and I look back over the last, you know, week or two, wow, I've learned way more in the last week or two than I do when I'm in school than I do, uh, pretty much anytime.  So, it's one of the most fast paced learning environments just in order to be a good teacher.  Uh, and I imagine you could get away without learning much as a teacher, just learn how to do it, and keep doing the same thing over, and over again, but this particular environment where I'm in at the moment, um, the school, uh, the curriculum's new every year, projects change, uh, it's always fast paced and changing,

and then, at the moment too, I also do a lot of tool usage, and tool proficiency.  Like teaching, teaching how to do a lot of the things that I have just sort of made up, and figured out for myself over the years.  Uh, a good example of that is, uh, well, figuring out for myself while being instructed on every once in a while, um, but often by my dad, or often by, uh, a friend of my dad's, something like that.  Not anything in sort of an official learning capacity.  Like soldering, that I learned from my dad's friend, or like, um, you know, using a screw driver.  Um, it's not...I don't even remember if my parents' instructed me on it, or if I just started doing it, or...I'm sure they helped at some point.  Um, but I saw so young, that was a long, long time ago, um, and so, helping with that process, and figuring out what are the common, and uncommon sort of misconceptions, or, um, where the advancements are just so that I can sort of give it to someone, um, in order to help them learn other things.  In that particular case, uh, letting someone fail for a just a second so that, you know, screwing a screw, and then showing them that if you put force behind the screwdriver, and the tip of it stays in the screw, that's a huge moment of realization that I get to have a couple of hundred times a year, or at least 60 times a year.

This mechanics of solids and structures course, I think it was Doug Brooks teaching it, and damned if he didn't shove more information into my head in an awesome, effective, willing way, in just two weeks, than I had spent laboring for a year and a half.  Um, and so for the rest of that class, I felt like it was a slam-dunk.  I really, really got mechanics, and every time he brought up more of those laws and, um, formulas from physics class, I'm, like, 'Oh, I got this.  I got this.'  And it was all in the teaching and the application.  Um, really it was just...I don't even want to say it was hands-on, but it was so practical, and based in reality, that I just, I just got it.  *laughs*

Um, for some reason I took what was going on in that class and I decided to combine it with my interest circuits and I, uh, as a final project spent a lot of time designing a circuit that would utilize, um, some of the concepts from the chaos theory and some of the concepts from, uh, communication theory and sort of, um, make the circuit.  So, I think now today I have a much stronger recall and, um, ability to use the basic building blocks from that class, um, that I probably would not have otherwise.  Like I'm sure if I've taken some other math elective, I think maybe I did, um, but I don't even remember it.  Um, like signals and system I don't think it was an elective, but I certainly just did not care much about that class, so I really don't remember anything from that class.  I don't remember how to do _____ [00:45:03] functions or impulse whatever stuff, um, but I do remember that chaos theory class and I do remember the _____ [00:45:10] that because of the work that I did when I was inspired to work on a project and investigate more on my own.

So, I'd like to say, you know, a little bit more exploratory education, so less, uh, me in the front and more about figuring out for, for themselves.  But, you know, certain topics, I do sometimes give them a meaning lecture - it's called that - and, you know, like, 'Here's what we're talking about, and these are the things we're going to be doing,' and I let them kind of ask their own questions and figure it out from there.

Um, and then, he wouldn't give you your exam back until you came to his office, and we found this out after discussing with everyone in the class, that every time a male student came back to the professor's office, the professor would look at the exam and ask the male student a couple of items from the test that the male student had tested poorly on.  And the male student would have the opportunity to work out the test question on the board and demonstrate some understanding, and then the professor would change the male student's test grade to reflect this understand.  And so a lot of the guys were ending with something in the A range on their exams.  The female students would walk back to the professor's office to pick up their exams, and he would look at it, and he'd shake his head, and he'd hand you the exam, and you'd leave.

*laughs*  Uh, so, recently, I've been feeling very constrained by education, just the system in general.  I felt a lot of the, uh, a lot of the expectations for teachers had shifted away actual teaching into more of, you know,  _____ [01:00:48] was like 400 documents of things you have to do, like, you know, to prove that you're teaching.

Okay.  Um, that one.  *laughs*  So, I felt, as a girl at Olin - well, maybe at Olin - that I maybe didn't have as many opportunities, either prior to Olin or at Olin, to access some of those more like...let's say I didn't really learn how to code.  And that's virtually on me.  Um, but I also felt that it was partially - and this is, you know, where I felt like a lot of the boys that came in had already experienced some of that.  And for whatever reason - I don't know if that was just because they were passionate about it, they pursued it, or actually it kind of was presented to them as something they should do, or that wasn't presented to me.

And not like...so I'm not quite sure about that, but I did feel like, coming into Olin, I didn't have some of the same experiences that, uh, some of the boys in my class had, and I felt, because Olin is so project oriented, that a lot of those projects where you had to work with a team, um, to meet a goal - which again, they have to do until it's done.  *laughs*  Um, where it had some kind of time constraint, um, because some of the, the boys had more experience in it, they were just going to fill those roles.  Where, like, I didn't feel I had the opportunity to fill some of those roles, because I hadn't had prior experience in some of those things.  So, I don't know if that's specifically because of gender, but I think it sort of lent itself to that.  So, yeah, I felt a lot like girls were there making the posters for the team project, which didn't really teach you very much.  So...

And then, uh, and doing _____ [01:07:54] finished the codes.  Anne  and I, we're on the team, and we were like, 'We don't know how to do that.'  So we ended up, like, figuring out how to decorate it, to make it, you know, appealing towards the elementary students who were coming in.  And while that was valuable to the overall project, it wasn't as valuable to our specific education, um, because we were there to learn the engineering side of it, not necessarily how to decorate it to make it the most appealing, you know.  So, you know, the little, little things like that, where at the time I didn't really think about...I didn't think about it, or I didn't think it was a problem, or anything like that.  But, thinking back, I'm like, 'Oh, that would have been an awesome opportunity to push myself and give myself that opportunity.'

Hmm, lots of reasons.  Um, I think the biggest one though is probably that, um, I really like the, uh, sort of novelty value, and the steep part of the learning curve getting used to a whole new discipline, and then, when I can see where a discipline is going I lose interest, and also, you know, once the work gets harder, and the sort of, um, feeling of how much new stuff I'm learning per amount of work that I'm putting in, uh, yeah, it drops.  Then, um, it becomes less interesting.  So, I sort of took early on a little bit of mechanical, a little bit of electrical, uh, a whole bunch of different, um, chemistry and material science, and just a bunch of different things, and I definitely could have still graduated, uh, mechanical, or electrical when I made that decision, but, um, the idea of continuing to just branch out and learn a bunch of different things, and then, tie it together somewhere toward the end where's, uh, it seemed both easy and inspiring.

P 7: 03-17-14-1-Fred.rtf - 7:81 [Yeah. So then, one thing I thi..]  (197:197)   (Super)
Codes:  [losing interest]

Yeah.  So then, one thing I think we glossed over is, um, why I got dissatisfied with engineering, um, and something that wasn't really clear from...well, that's not even actually fair to say.  Um, when I first started off in engineer, which was actually the summer before I started Olin, uh, in between high school and college, um, it was very open ended.  I was only working on prototypes, it was, uh, it was sort of, it was almost like research and exploration in a lab, um, and I wasn't working on finished products.  Um, and then, that's pretty much how a freshman year at Olin started off too is bottle rockets, and cars, and projects to build, and, um, yeah, there's a lot of math, and a lot of science, but I was used to that from school, and that's fine.  Um, and then, uh, as school went on, uh, it got to be a lot more of the sort of book learning side of things, and a lot more of the sort of intense academic atmosphere, uh, which I don't think I enjoyed as much as the hands on project building things, uh, but it doesn't really, especially after investing a couple of years in it, uh, you know, wonder off and find something else, but I guess a few students do.  Um, and then, getting a job as an engineer afterward, um,  it was just eight months, you know, an eight month sort of contract, um, I slowly got sort of dissatisfied with the lifestyle of engineering.  Um, high stress,  low novelty, um, and not being able to turn my brain off to the questions of efficiency, and of whatever design we were working on at the time, and working with same people all the time.  I was working with...a hundred and fifty people, all who I knew all around for a year, missing most of them the next year, um, there's just a lot of things that I really missed about college without necessarily missing the, um, yeah.  The book learning side of it.  Um, and I also missed...some of the hands on projects.  That was one of my favourite parts of the engineering job, but a lot of it was not hands on projects, a lot of it was documentation, and CAD work, and, um, and then, I would get home feeling like I hadn't been focused all day, feeling like I was like not as productive as I could have been, sort of dissatisfied with the state of things, thinking about all the problems, um, maybe have a beer and go to bed.  Um, or distract myself with a movie, and that became sort of a normal thing, uh, which was really dissatisfying, um, and I think it's really common from an engineer, from what I've seen recently to have sort of an unhealthy lifestyle, especially mentally, and emotionally, um, but not really notice it, not really care about it because they're doing good work, they're pushing things forward, they're making intriguing designs, they're mentally engaged, um, and that's enough for some people, um, and I got tired of it, and travelling, and then, when I got broke, I went back to it, and then, I quit earlier the next time, about six months.  Um, and then, went travelling again, and then, when I got broke again, then I went back to it, but I was pretty sure that time it was going to be the last time.  Um, so, then I worked for four months in engineering, and yeah.  That was the end of that, and I think I mentioned I worked a bunch of odd jobs, um, and that was while I was trying to figure out what am I gonna do if not engineering, um, and Olin prepared me for a ton of different things.  I thought of careers as a geologist.  I think I mentioned nursing, um, and a bunch of other things.  I was pretty happy in the cool tech service business for at least two or three months.  Um, other than that  as long as it held my interest, but, um teaching on the other hand fixes almost all of those problems for me.  It's fast paced, and engaging without being too stressful.  Um, it's...the novelty value is off the charts, um, there's a lot less struggles, and less...I understand that public school teachers have to deal with a lot more, certainly a lot more than I do right now.  Um, our school tries to run really lean on, um, any sort of unnecessary bureaucratic things.  Um, and yeah.  I think I also mentioned the engineering, I felt pretty isolated from a lot of people, the same sort of 10 to 15 people on a regular basis, and I worked on small teams with them, and, um,  I didn't know all the kids names that I teach these days because I teach fourth grade up to ninth grade.  Um, so, it's all new things to learn about people, and it's just, it's just really exciting and fast paced, and so, that's why I say I think it will hold my interest for at least another three years, maybe as much as ten.

It's to me that, like, takes away from the whole point of being a teacher, you know?  Having interactions with students where you're, like, getting them excited and passionate about learning.  I don't know.  

So, I think, uh, I think of those, those little...they're all little things, but they all...all the little things add up to a lot, and I think all those little things are wearing on me.  And so, I don't see myself staying in the classroom for another six years, but I don't really know what's next either, so I don't want to give up those awesome moments of, you know, 'Oh, gosh, that was so cool,' and, like, you know, I was able to help them, or whatever it is.  So I don't want to give that part of it up.  So that might mean maybe teaching in high school or...but, yeah, I don't think it will be in the classroom, because of that.

And someone, one of my friends who had been in that conversation came up to me, I think the next morning, and told me about that conversation, um, because I was one of the people on that list.  And then, when they had looked at that list again, they had realized that I was the only female on that list.  And they went, 'Oh, that...that's funny. Why is Christine the only female on this list?  Hmm.'  And then that, that got people talking about, 'Well, how did we make this list?  How did we make this list?  What criteria did we choose such that there was one woman on this list?'

As I was a part of the human-powered vehicles team, and the year I was super active on it, there was one other woman on the team, um, and a, and a bunch of guys.  And we were having a bunch of team dynamics issues, um, including...that, that were mostly focused around the other woman, not because she was a woman but because there was some disagreement between her and the rest of the team in terms of working style and stuff.  And so, at some point it was decided at the team...among the team that one of us should go and talk with Lynn  to ask her to help us figure out better engineering team dynamics stuff.  And, and in a conversation with the entire team except for the one woman that was being problematic, the, the rest of us sort of collectively decided that I was going to be the one to, to talk with Lynn about this. And so, I went and talked with Lynn about this, and, and then one of the things Lynn pointed out that I hadn't noticed was, 'Did you notice, Christine, that when the one other woman on the team was having issues team-dynamic-wise, you, you happened to be the only other woman on the team and all the guys basically sent you to talk with the female faculty member about team dynamic problems with the other female on this team?' And I went, 'Well, well, statistically speaking, that could totally be random chance, but...yeah, I see what you mean.' So that, that, that was not necessarily gender dependent, but it was a conversation in which gender...the dynamics of gender was, um, was revealed in an interesting way. And I don't think, I, I don't think that if I talked with a male faculty member, that conversation would have happened. I doubt if anybody would have noticed it, um, and, you know, maybe, maybe there's something to what Lynn said, that if I had been a guy and she had been the only girl on the team and...that my gender had something to do with my being asked to talk with Lynn and Lynn's gender had something to do with me being asked to talk with Lynn.

Umm, let's see.  Hmm.  So, on gender and engineering, there's a slightly different context.  I had that interesting experience when I was at, worked on my MBA.

Uh, so it was a little bit funny to have...which were...as many of them were male, predominantly male, when I was a 20-something female, thrown into the mix, working on MBA stuff.  Which, you know, I don't think it actually was a negative impact and didn't feel like that meant they'd listen to me any less, which is very typically what you'd expect.  

Um, in fact, I definitely had a team that was populated by 40- to 50-year-old male engineers, who _____ [00:55:23] engineers, nonetheless, who I convinced to work, develop our business plan, uh, like _____ [00:55:33] do, Gothic cathedral in New Orleans and put _____ [00:55:38] into our quirky constitution, and they were totally on board.

Okay.  Yeah, it was, um, my classmate, Jamie, and he was same year as me, and we worked on a lot of freshman projects together, and, you know, he was, he was so good at, uh, displaying a lot of things.  If you guys don't have him in your study or if he's not participating, it would be great to get him, because he was really great at being at the, at the whiteboard and explaining certain concepts to me.  And I'd always ask him, like, a lot of questions on explaining certain things, whether it was like some...our physics class or, you know, drawing box diagrams and stuff, and figuring out, um, how things work together.  

And what was nice about him too, like, not only could he show things in a great visual, um, format, but he was also really nice about highlighting things that you were good at.  So, you know, I didn't have a lot of skills in terms of, like, engineering.  Like I said, I thought an engineer was a train, like a train operator or something; I mean, even when I first got into Olin.  But, you know, I was good at certain things.  Like, I was really good at conceptualizing, you know, chemical compounds and figuring out those things, and I was really good at some, like, basic math principles and being able to, you know, balance things and write things that way.  And he was really encouraging me, because he would always kind of compliment those things I was really good at, and, like, you know, ask for help on those specific parts, so I felt like I was... you know, it kind of gave me confidence and encouragement.  Okay, like, maybe I'm not super...I'm not very good at these specific engineering concepts, but, you know, with help and stuff like that, but at least I'm good at these certain things, and I can help other people too. 

So I think, yeah, I totally appreciated him for that, and that was early on, so, you know, it was great to have him.  I mean, everyone also was really encouraging and great too at, um, at Olin, and always willing to help out.  Like, this other...I'm blanking on his name right now - um, I want to say Dave.  Like, I remember we were working on a project together, and he was really great at doing this, um...we were doing coding, and I'd never done any coding before.   And, he was, he had, like, so many years of experience already, coding, and was kind of taking the lead on, um...you know, we were working on some projects for, I forget which class.  Um, but we were, like, dropped into coding, and I'd never even seen, like, any type of code language before.  But, you know, even though we were...we sort of worked together, he kind of did most of the work on the coding part.  

And then we were, like, pretty much really done with it, but I really didn't understand, like, any of what he did, and he stayed late after hours and, um, would sit there, and we finished maybe at 10 or something.  And then, you know, I told him I was...I don't get, like, any of this, really, and he stayed with me, until like, I don't know, 3 a.m. and helped walk through kind of every line of code.  And, you know, it must've been really tedious for him, because he was explaining probably really rudimentary concepts that he learned, like, years ago, but that I was barely seeing for the first time.  Um, so I mean, that was...yeah, I vividly remember that experience.  

Then people were just always willing to put that time and effort into helping, helping others out, and, you know, not going to, like, parties or something, or doing other fun activities.  It was just like, 'I wanted to help,' help people and help everyone get to the level that they need to be at.

, and I remember we had to write these reports on something about like, something about like gender roles too, and how that played into that whole culture, and I kind of thought it was BS at the time until I read, I read a report that, um, someone else in our group had done, it was a guy actually, and he was talking about how, uh, it was something about like, um, how something that is sexualizing doesn't have to be demeaning, but it's hard like, to  disentangle those two things from each other which is reflective on our society, or something, and everyone's like, pretty deep, and actually pretty moving, and I remember reading his, um, report, and feeling so guilty that I had half assed mine, and I went back, and I redid it, um, and like read a bunch of major articles about it online.  Like, oh hey, I learned something, you know.  I didn't have to, right, it's a passionate pursuit, and I'll probably get a credit or whatever, whatever I've written.  Um, but I don't regret it all.

I hope so.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard for me to pin point it.  Uh, something...I think my two major contributing skill sets...like a team at Olin, you know, it always varies from project to project, um, I'm just talking about the consistent one.  Uh, I do think that like, uh, by nature I really like variety, and so, I like doing a bunch of different activities, and I think by far at Olin, the calibre of the students with soft skills greatly outreaches that of the typical engineering student.  Uh, but I do think that like, I have more of an artsy side than the typical Olin student...so, bringing in that element of, of aesthetic, and design to things, which like I mean, is something that we're often learning for our classes, I would be able to connect to that more easily, and help other students with that.  Uh, I mean, I think this is pretty typical, but I remember training around, like posters, um, and PowerPoint with a bunch of students, and always like helping, like, you know, it would look nicer if these were aligned, tips and tricks like that, um, and maybe on a more like compelling level, um, although it's harder for me to describe what this is...something that I've been told is that, um, I have a really blunt way of looking at things sometimes, and so, like, uh, I don't know, to me, I'm always thinking really of how do you get from point A to point B.  Like, what is the direct approach to it, um, or they think like, in my mind a lot of people get caught on tangents and stuff, um, and then, they like, get into these little loops of like, how do I solve this part.  Um, but just being able to oh well, we'll do this, and somehow it will work out, and then we'll go over here, and  somehow it'll work out, and this is obviously the next step that would follow after that.  So, just being like very, like direct, enabled, like cut things down to bare bones structure, and then build up again from there.  Like, filling in the details, um, I don't know if that made sense.

Um, let me think of one I can share.  So, there's this girl who sits near me in the office, and she's constantly asking me, who do I call for this?  Who do I, you know, ask for this?  Who do I do this?  And, uh, we have a shared resource, a wiki page, that lists all of those people by office, and it would answer every single one of her questions.  And, uh, I have tried answering her with names off of the wiki page and citing the wiki page so she knows where it came from.  I have tried sending her the wiki page directly and trying to get her to use to fish for herself.  I have sent it, you know, in chat.  I have sent in email.  And I've had other people send it to her.  I've had her bookmark it in her browser.  Um, I've...you know, when she's asked me a question, I've told her, just go to the wiki page.  And she's one of those people who...that's simply not how she chooses to learn.  She's very in denial that she has to know this information and that she needs to use this information, and that I can't be this constant source for that information.  

Um, and so, as it just so happens, she and I got into a fight one day.  That's something completely different, and I'm okay with this.  And, uh, I did my side of the making up, and she just never cared to do hers, so she just won't talk to me.  And I'm cool with that right now, because she's actually kind of being a bitch.  And, uh...but the side effect is that she won't ask me for the questions...she won't ask me for answers, and so then she has to ask our incompetent teammate, and our incompetent teammate can't answer because he's incompetent.  And so what does she do?  She's like, 'Oh, crap.  What resources do I have at my disposal to answer this?'  *laughs*  And, so, uh, apparently she's the kind of person who just learns because she has no better option.  She finally started to use the resource that's been provided and understand that it's part of her job to do that, when it's a last resort.  And it's...I felt like that was one of my non-successes at teaching.  In the end, she finally learned, but I was not successful at teaching that, because she just had absolutely no interest whatsoever in learning.  

Um, whereas, I had a different co-worker who need the same resource, and I passed it to him once, and now he uses it religiously.  He can't believe he didn't know about this resource before.  It is gold for him, and, um, so the wiki page is, like, his magic treasure, and he's so appreciative that I gave it to him.  And it's that the desire to learn was so important, and I felt frustrated with myself as a teacher for not being able to teach my bitch of a co-worker, and, um, and now I feel that it really, to some extent, in that specific case, it wasn't necessarily my fault.  *laughs*  I'm not letting myself off the hook.  There's certainly other places where it has been my fault that I haven't been effective in teaching people, but, um, anyway...

Um, most of those end up being, I think, serendipitous.  Um, I find that I can do something that someone else can't, and they ask me for help and I show them.  And then they tell someone else, um, kind of through the grapevine, and then I'll have this kind of stream of people who all want to learn the same thing.  And if it's super easy, then I can just teach a stream of people together.  Um, and in some of the more complex cases, I put together a little course, and I'll do something like a practicum, where I bring together the slides, and everyone comes and brings their laptop or whatnot, and we all practice together, um, to learn the material.  So people get to choose whichever they learn best.  You know, they can just listen, they can watch/read the slides, they can try it themselves, whatever.   And those are some of the ones that have ended up working the best.  

There was one time when my company was rolling out Microsoft Office 2007, and that was a big change from 2003, right?  They introduced the ribbon, and all these other new features, and you get a lot of people in their 50s and 60s who just never cared to learn how to use computers independently.  Um, so they don't...they get something new, and they don't just click around and try things.  They don't say, 'Well, what does this do?  What does this do?'  I mean, read the help _____. [01:02:19].  They're just like, 'Oh, God!' and they freeze, um, and so that happened to be a very effective class on Microsoft Office 2007.

Um, isn't that great that they happened to find the best design?'

And I would answer them, and they would still talk to the guys. And then, you know, at that point, my entire team started having conversations about gender because they were, like, 'Why would they not talk to Christine? Why can't they just talk to her?' I've gone to, um, technical, like, software start-up mixers and had, had a name badge and, and everything, like a normal attendee, and had people say, 'Oh, are you here with your boyfriend?'

I thought that you were (1) a guy, (2) white, and (3) about 10 years older that you actually are.'  So, I'm going, 'Okay, why...'  And, and, and I had a really good reputation. I was quite well respected in those communities. And so, um, you know, I started wondering, 'If you saw me in person first, would you...would we have had the same level of initial respect? Why did you assume that I was a, you know, white man in my early thirties?  Because I was...was it because I was good and that's what you think good people look like?'

And I went, 'Well, well, statistically speaking, that could totally be random chance, but...yeah, I see what you mean.' So that, that, that was not necessarily gender dependent, but it was a conversation in which gender...the dynamics of gender was, um, was revealed in an interesting way. And I don't think, I, I don't think that if I talked with a male faculty member, that conversation would have happened. I doubt if anybody would have noticed it, um, and, you know, maybe, maybe there's something to what Lynn said, that if I had been a guy and she had been the only girl on the team and...that my gender had something to do with my being asked to talk with Lynn and Lynn's gender had something to do with me being asked to talk with Lynn.

Like, I would learn more about teaching and then it would change the way I saw my teachers as a student or, like, I would see things that they were doing and then I'd be, like, 'Oh, I should do that as a teacher' or I would see things that other students in eDisco were doing and then, like, start doing that.

I think, I think during, uh, that SPIC-CB  course, the specialized UB  course my freshman year, because we spent so much time doing group-based problems.  And especially coming just out of high school, I realized this was very, very different from anything I'd done in high school, partially just because it was so challenging that you had to work in big groups to figure it out, versus in high school, where you just didn't need to.

You know, I think second year or something, we were doing a big curricular review, and talking about all of the different ways we had taught things, and ways we can teach things.  You know, teachers are always looking...you know, you're always being asked for feedback on how we are teaching this course, how can we potentially think about teaching a different course.  I mean, it was asking for that kind of...or the teachers asking for that kind of feedback and getting it that led to us actually splitting the curriculum into two pieces my second semester at Olin, and having a group that did all project _____ [00:41:37] , or a group that did, sort of, mixed project, lecture-based.  Um, so I think, by the end of my first year at Olin, I was well aware that there were many different ways to teach, um, which made me more critical and aware of all of the ways to teach that I have seen from that point forward, through the rest of my teaching career, or _____ [00:42:01] career.

Uh, I also went to the ISTE, something about technology, and education, I forget what the conference acronym stands for, um, last year, and also there was Design Thinking Institute which is later over the summer to teach other educators how to teach design thinking, um, and so, I was sort of taking the two last year as a student sort of learning tech and support for, um, and I'll be leading one of the rooms this year.

Um, but just being able to oh well, we'll do this, and somehow it will work out, and then we'll go over here, and  somehow it'll work out, and this is obviously the next step that would follow after that.

How do they learn best?  They might not even learn best...you know, item A, in the same way they learn item B.  So I really like to know who needs the teaching, who's doing the learning, um, in order to understand how this knowledge should be transferred.  I think that's even more evident nowadays.  I happened to take a language and an adult education class at the local high school, and I see them teaching us the same way they teach the high schoolers, and it's, it's just so not effective.  *laughs*  I mean, you've got to kind of learn that adults learn a little differently than children, and that different adults learn differently from others, like different kids learn differently.  Um, and I think that's, that's really important.  If you're going to transfer the knowledge, why do so in a way that's painful, or a way that's ineffective or inefficient?

But even with that, I had no idea what engineering was, and even though I was in American Math and Science School, I wanted to be an art graphic design major.  Um, I told my parents this; they had serious objection to this idea and I thought, 'Well, then what do you want me to study?'  And they said, 'You're good at math and science; you should do engineering' and I didn't know what that was, but it was something they wanted me to study.  So, I looked into that and I realized that it made more sense than the other options that they told me that I could consider.  It was, 'Now that we are in America, you have four options for your career: medicine, law, business, or engineering - pick one.'  And engineering seemed to me like the most creative one and the closest I would be able to get to art, so, um, I started applying to engineering colleges and fortunately that ended up being a good fit.  But it was incredibly accidental.  I didn't choose engineering and I didn't get interested in engineering until I had already basically decided I was going to study engineering whether I was interested or not.

I started working with professors, um, that were doing those workshops, and they were doing some open-source projects.  I really like hanging out with professors, and while I was at Olin I had actually decided that I wanted to become a professor, um, but had been temporarily steered away from it for a little while because we couldn't figure out a PhD program that would fit me.

You should really rethink what you want to do after graduation.  Please promise me that you will do something related to engineering education at some point in your life, in some way.'  So, so I thought, 'Yeah, I, I'll, I'll, I'll do that, somehow.'

So, I wasn't...it was what I would always say because it seemed...like, it fit, it wasn't...but it wasn't something I was, like, really firmly attached to in my head.

I mean, for me, like, designing my major was a big part of that, like, that I...like, I chose what classes I wanted to take and what order I wanted to take them in.  Um, and so, like, all of the physics that I took was because I was interested in it and I wanted to and, like, as I was, you know, declaring my major, I had to, like, kind of think through, like, 'What do I really want to, like, get out of being at Olin?' and then, like, 'Where...like, if this is what I want to do, like, if I want to basically take all the requirements of a physics major at another school, like, how do I make that happen when Olin doesn't necessarily offer all those classes?'  So, like, sort of choosing to cross-register and, like, choos-...or, like, for some...in some cases, I cross-registered, like, I took physics class at Wellesley, I took physics class at Brandeis, but then I also, like, did an OSS in solid-state physics because I was, like, 'I want to learn this.  Olin used to have this class.  There aren't enough students interested for you to offer it anymore, so I'm just going to, like, take it anyway as an OSS.'

Codes:  [reflections on wanting]

Um, it was sophomore year, during winter break.  Um, there was...I'd taken an education class at Wellesley in the fall, um, and my teacher was involved in this...it was an alternative teacher preparation program called Boston Teacher Residency.  Um, so, I'd learned about it in that class and they...so, that's...it's called BTR, the program.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and BTR was, like, hosting this winter session thing for college students who were interested in becoming teachers where we would... like, we shadowed high school teachers, um, in Boston, like, teachers who'd graduated from BTR, mostly, like, in the schools that you would teach in if you were...if you went to BTR.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and so, during...it was only, like, two weeks in, like, January.  Um, I was shadowing this high school math teacher, um, and he...like, we got along really well.  Like, I think his teaching philosophy and mine were, like, really well aligned in a way that, like...so, I was, like, happy to be in his classroom because, like, I was really into, like, sort of open-ended things and having students, like, grapple with ideas themselves and, like, not just, like, telling students answers.  And, like, he also did that, like, his whole class was a lot of, like, problem solving and students just, like, working through stuff, and he did...he was, like...he did a lot of stuff with, like, differentiating so, like, different students could work on different problems and, like, work through the curriculum at their own pace.  Um, and so, basically, like, the whole time I was in his classroom, like, I think I saw him stand up and, like, address students once for, like, more than just, like, 'Hi, welcome to the day!' type of thing.

I: Hmm, hmm.
[01:21:45]
P: Um, and the whole rest of the time, I was just, like, getting to help students, like, do math problems, um, and, like, really enjoyed it.  And so, there was just kind of, like...there...basically there was just, like, this moment where I was helping a student with a problem, um, and I just kind of, like, stepped back in my head and was, like, 'This is what I want to do with my life.'  Like, just stepped back and realized, like, 'I'm so happy right now, like, in this classroom.  Like, I just...it feels right being here.  Um, and, like, this is what I want to do in my life.'  And I think...so, that was kind of, like, the moment...like, I came back to Olin for spring semester and I was, like, 'I'm going to be a teacher, like, a hundred percent for sure, this is what I'm doing after I graduate!'  Um, and I actually think that...like, that experience happened outside of Olin and it, like, it had to happen, at least for me, while I was not at Olin.  Like, the, the, like, 'Do I want to be a teacher or not?' like, that was a question that had been in my head a lot prior to that, um, like, as I was taking that education class in, like, sophomore fall.  Like, I was definitely thinking about it a lot and thinking about, like, 'What do I want to do after Olin?'  Um, and even though I knew I loved teaching, it was really hard for me to make the decision that I was not going to be an engineer when I was constantly surrounded by people who were all engineers...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Or all planning to be engineers.  And so, it was actually, like, leaving Olin, even if only for, like, a month at winter break, and being around people who wanted to be teachers, that I was able to be, like, 'Yes, like, it is...like, this is what I want and, like, I can go to Olin and, like, still, like, enjoy engineering but not want to be an engineer.'  Um...

I: Okay.

P: Which is...I guess that's kind of a little weird because it's...like, nobody at Olin ever told me I had to be an engineer.  Nobody at Olin ever, like, even, like, talked badly about becoming a teacher.  Like, no one said, 'Don't do that,' but it was still just, like...just, just the fact of being around people who all were doing that made it harder to make the decision not to.

At which point, I called my mom -- she was a doctor -- and said, 'So, you know how I said I was never going to be a doctor?  Can I shadow some people when I came home for Thanksgiving?'

Um, when I was growing up, I went through a couple of different phases where I thought I was interested various fields.  Um, first I thought it was physics, and then I thought it was chemistry, and then I thought it was chemical engineering or nuclear engineering, and then I just kind of realized that I wasn't really finding a school or a program that really spoke to me for either of those disciplines, and I realized I just liked the, the idea of engineering in general.  Um, although back in high school I still couldn't define what engineering was or what an engineer did.  Um, I think it took, actually, a couple of years at Olin for me to understanding what engineering is and what an engineer does.  Um, but in that sense, Olin was really, definitely the right school for me, um, so I'm glad I figured out at some point in high school that I wanted to do engineering.

I was, like, 'Oh, I guess maybe.'  Um, so, yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of one of those weird moments.  Yeah, I don't...it was like I said I kind of...I was very unsure of, like, what to do, and even with my major, I did so much of everything, that I didn't even know, like, what I was focused on.  I'm, like, kind of all over the place.  And so, I didn't know where to go after graduation.  I didn't know, like, what kind of engineering I would want to do, or if engineering was even really the right thing.

Can you say more about that? 

Karen:

*laughs*  Uh, so, recently, I've been feeling very constrained by education, just the system in general.  I felt a lot of the, uh, a lot of the expectations for teachers had shifted away actual teaching into more of, you know,  _____ [01:00:48] was like 400 documents of things you have to do, like, you know, to prove that you're teaching.  It's to me that, like, takes away from the whole point of being a teacher, you know?  Having interactions with students where you're, like, getting them excited and passionate about learning.  I don't know.  

So, I think, uh, I think of those, those little...they're all little things, but they all...all the little things add up to a lot, and I think all those little things are wearing on me.  And so, I don't see myself staying in the classroom for another six years, but I don't really know what's next either, so I don't want to give up those awesome moments of, you know, 'Oh, gosh, that was so cool,' and, like, you know, I was able to help them, or whatever it is.  So I don't want to give that part of it up.  So that might mean maybe teaching in high school or...but, yeah, I don't think it will be in the classroom, because of that.

Another word that I think would be good in that earlier question of, uh, what is a teacher is interpreter.  And interpreter of phenomena, or of fact, of of just an interpreter in general, um, which is also tied in a little bit, uh, slightly off topic, but it also ties in a little bit with my sort of eventual retirement plan of Park Ranger, because there's two different types of National Park Rangers.  The enforcement one that carries a gun and enforces rules, and all those things, um, and the other type is called Interpretation Rangers.  Uh, sort of trying to interpret nature for everybody, um, and interpret what does it mean to go on a back country hike, and all those things.  Um, and specifically for lay people, and for people who are not nature experts, or even for people who are, but are only in one field, and so, you're trying to add some value for everybody.  Yeah, I think an interpreter is a really good description for what a teacher is.

You're right.  Yeah.  I...how do I say it, I think that part of what I struggled with, and actually I've been recently trying to make through is that I think part of it is just the venue of teaching for me.  Like, I definitely find reading with these kids a lot more satisfying than anything else that I've done.  Um, and I think, I don't know if it's guilt or something, but the part of it is that I really do know that in this area, it's a lot  different than the environment that I grew up in, and it's really easy for me to see now all these, uh, advantages, and like, ways that people helped me as I was a kid, and I feel like I'm really lucky to be where I am now, and so, I'm like, oh, I need to like, like I need to help out.  Like, I feel really happy that I received all these opportunities as a kid, and I think that like, that should be more available to kids.  Um, and the more that I do here, especially because I had, I had to teach, um, I had to TA for college classes, but then, sort of like aiding K through 12.  Like you can really see how it fills up, and how like, set backs early on, just like, gain momentum, and to like, larger set backs later on, but then, like how helping out a young age often can have such a propagating effect.  And so, like I think, like when you can see that picture more clearly, um, you see that there's like a real need to help out.  And so, I don't know, for me, I do, and I even feel bad for disliking it like, I should feel more fulfilled, which is why I'm trying to do a few different things that I thought maybe I could find the ones that I like more, and stick with those.  So, it should be something like, that I think is good, and morally satisfying, and also like, genuinely like pleasuring, like, as an individual...

I mean, I think I considered it, um, but what I really enjoy more is one-on-one interactions and my kind of more in-depth interactions.  Um, and I felt like teaching, you're always dealing with a...at least in secondary education, you're always dealing with, in high school there are, like, always 30 kids now, and most colleges have huge classrooms of people.  And you're not really, in those scenarios, you're almost not really, by my definition, as I mentioned earlier, you're not really teaching.  You're more showing, explaining as best you can, but there's no back and forth dialogue necessarily, or it's impossible to have back and forth dialogue with every single individual on a personal basis to make sure that they're actually internalizing what you're doing.  And to me, that would be too, almost like depressing.  Yeah, you're kind of showing concepts, and you're teaching things at, at a high level, and maybe some people will get it, but the truth is, some people really won't get it.  And that would, you know, kind of suck, because I would know that there's no way there'd be enough time for me to individually meet with every single person and, you know, explain certain things.  

So, like, what I get most happiness about on the tutoring and mentoring side is it's really personal.  It's really one on one.  It's really customized education, fit to that person, so you're almost taken into the...you have to take into account, like, their quirks, what works for them, if you have to be more lenient, if you have to be, more stringent on certain things, if you have to take a certain approach.  You know, for example, you always...I always give a lot of examples in either tutoring or, like, mentoring on, you know, something's that worked for me.  So you have to pull from...you know, you have a huge, vast pool of examples, and you have to pull the one that's going to fit into some interest of that person and make them understand it.  Or, um, pull one that's something that they, I don't know, are...I guess, what I said earlier; it interests them, so then they're going to be able to understand it.  You know, that person's really into...for example, my stepsister is really into, like, horses, so I pull in examples of something like, I don't know, whatever is related to horses or animals or something like that.

So, I went and got a bunch of advanced couple of books and put together a couple of packets for him on math and science stuff, and he was so excited that he got the kit and started working on these when he finished with his packets.  

Um, but I think the coolest part about that was that I gave Timmy, that was his name, his puzzle packet, and he started working on it, and then a couple of days later, I had one of the other, really quiet, kids come to me and say, 'Can I have a puzzle packet too?'  And she wasn't quite so far ahead that we could, you know, have her not do the class activities, so I gave her a puzzle packet, but said, 'Okay, we're going to do this an after-school activity,' and then I started getting two or three or four others who'd start coming to me, asking if I, if they could do puzzles too, which is the point at which I started organizing, um, breakfast puzzle sessions.

 it also sort of underscores the difference between like a 15-person classroom, and a, you know, like a lecture hall full of a 100, or 200 people, that 15 or 20-person classroom, you can have an individual conversation with almost everyone in the room even if it's just a few minutes for each student.  Um, a couple hundred people in a lecture hall, it's a one way conversation for the most part.  Um, you can occasionally take questions from a few students, but it's usually gonna be the same student over and over again.  They're usually gonna be kind of clarifying anything you've glaringly missed, but, um, yeah.  It's just not the same.  It's not a super beneficial environment I think for learning the sort of things that I want to learn.

Um, and then, there's more hands on courses, there's, uh, my humanity course which was perhaps the most useful part of my education so far, um, because it ended up enabling me to teach, um, my humanities competition was in phonetic linguistics.  So, when I got to Egypt, and I wanted to teach example lessons, I just did the first day of my Intro to Phonetics course, um, and I taught a few teachers, um, and then, I put in a few customized things for Arabic speakers, um, and they were totally blown away, and I got a job immediately.  Um, and so, yeah.  All the different learning styles that you have to sort of adapt, the classical, unifying that would be a huge mistake.  I heard some talk about that over an e-mail list at one point.  Um, it was like, no, do not unify the language style, that's not what needs to happen, the variety and the necessity of variety that everyone has to try to do everything, um, is one of the strong points I think.

I mean, like when someone doesn't understand something, you really have to dive into why that is, and it could be that they're missing out on a lot of like fundamental knowledge, and so, there are gaps.  Um, like study groups before you were trying to teach the subject that you were actually supposed to pursue.  I think that so many people think very, very differently, and so, it's hard to adapt your mind set to what another person could be.  So, you need that flexibility of thought process.

Those are things that normal organizers and designers don't bring to the table, you know, they just bring their taste and their processes there, and they're like, 'Okay, we'll do it this way.'

I, I know that, um, in the past, I liked to include a 'how'; like, a teaching style or method.  And I am very against that nowadays.  Um, it goes back to knowing the customer, knowing the user.  How do they learn best?  They might not even learn best...you know, item A, in the same way they learn item B.  So I really like to know who needs the teaching, who's doing the learning, um, in order to understand how this knowledge should be transferred.  I think that's even more evident nowadays.  I happened to take a language and an adult education class at the local high school, and I see them teaching us the same way they teach the high schoolers, and it's, it's just so not effective.  *laughs*  I mean, you've got to kind of learn that adults learn a little differently than children, and that different adults learn differently from others, like different kids learn differently.  Um, and I think that's, that's really important.  If you're going to transfer the knowledge, why do so in a way that's painful, or a way that's ineffective or inefficient?

And, um, I'm trying to figure out why, and I realized it's because, you know, they've come to me with similar questions, and I didn't take the time to redo my teaching methods, um, to match their needs.  And, so over the last eight years or so of being a person in the working environment who spends a fair amount of time trying to transfer knowledge to other coworkers, I've really...again, I learned the hard way, and now I'm doing a much better job at, uh, trying to understand how people best learn individually, and then using that to transfer knowledge.  

Um, I noticed, interestingly enough, that, you know, when a new employee comes on board, and you try to bring them up to speed, a lot of people call it, you know, putting them through a fire hose or whatever, drinking from a fire hose.  And it doesn't have to be, because if you feed it to them in a way that really makes sense, or where it really immerses them in something that they can really absorb it better...but you can't figure that out just by having a five-minute conversation with them.  And you can't figure it out just by throwing everything over the fence to them.  Uh, it takes a day or two to understand what parts of the information they're absorbing best, and figure out what parts they're kind of rejecting or having trouble accepting, and then you're more able to tailor it.  

And in that sense, the learning relationship between the teacher and the student happens best, over at least a small period of time.  Um, I find it very hard to teach something to someone if I've never met them before, you know.  If somebody asks me on the street the directions to the next, you know, grocery store, are they the kind of person who wants to know how many streets you go before you turn?  Are they the person who wants to turn by landmarks, or are they the person who wants to turn by street names?  I have no idea.  My husband is geographically challenged and wants the landmarks...or, excuse me; he's geographically challenged and wants the street names.  Um, I happen to like landmarks, and I know there's, you know, other people who like counting.

Like, some of them did kind of, like, the typical, like, um, tie a string around the axle and, like, set it...attach it to the part of the mousetrap that moves when you release it.  Um, but then, like, one group created this thing where it only had two wheels and the whole car rotated.  Like, there was two wheels and then this piece of foam core between the two wheels that was...like, the length of the sides was less than the diameter of the wheels, so as the wheels rolled, the whole piece would just roll with it.  Um, and they would kind of, like, lightly get the car rolling forward such that it would...as it was rolling, it would then hit the mousetrap, like, something attached to the bottom of the car would hit the mousetrap, which would set it off and it would, like, go rocketing forward a lot faster.  And I was just, like, 'I never would have thought of that in a million years.  That is, like, so cool!'  *laughs*  And, like, there were other things like that.  Like, there were a lot of...there were, like, nine groups and nine very different designs in my class.  And so, just, like, seeing students come up with things like that is, like, always, like, really fun for me.

Well, some of it is being...I always lean first towards people figuring things out for themselves as much as I think I can.  Um, so obviously if I'm teaching someone brain surgery for the first time, I'm not going to say, 'Here's a rat.  Put this piece of metal into its brain,' because that's not a really fair level of teaching.  But based on how much I knew he was comfortable with animals to start with, I could sort of say, 'Okay, you've done this sort of injection before.  This one is like this other sort of injection.  Try it.'  I might hear a few final questions, versus other parts, where he's never done anything like it before.  I would say, 'Okay, you know, you don't have any background in this.  Let me show you one, and then you're going to try one.'  So it's very judgment-based on how much I know how much background they have, and what are the potential ramifications if they can't figure it out or can't do it right.

 For this year, actually, I am the TA for the senior biomedical engineering design class at _____, [00:23:50]  and I remember walking in for the first teaching team meeting and having the professor say, 'Okay, this is really the first time these guys have ever been given, you know, an open-ended question where they just need to figure out as a team how to solve it. So they're going to be really first-out and have no idea what to do.'  And I remember going, 'Say, what?  They're senior biomedical engineers, and this is their first what?'  And it's very true that they basically have only had lecture-based teaching for the most part, and they definitely struggled quite a bit with the, um, idea of an open-ended question they needed to figure out how to solve for themselves.  Um, like, such as, we had a team that was working on developing a new virus detection system for, um, you know, the common cold, and they're basically, 'Okay, so tell me what the specifications that you want us to _____ [00:24:48] are for.'  I said, 'Well, who do you need to talk to to figure out what the specifications are?'  And they're like, 'Well, aren't you going to tell us what the specifications are?'  I said, 'No.  You need to figure this out.  Who do you think you need to talk to?'  

Um, it really astounding to me how completely ill-equipped this entire senior class of engineers was to do any sort of open-ended question.  It made me realize that Olin, what we did from day one was, 'Okay, you need to model two stars going around each other.  Go.'  And you'd have to go figure it out.  Or, say, I really loved my failure engineering class at Olin, where he basically said, 'Well, here is a big cart of broken things.  You're going to work in groups, and you're going figure out why they broke.  I will be happy to teach you about all of the machines in here, and go.'  Um, and it was great.  I ended up, like, writing up a paper on it with my other group-mates, and we learned a ridiculous amount about, um, metal engineering.  I'm not sure if that really answers the question, though.

Um, I think I had an unusually huge amount of control over my path of learning.  Um, I mean, from Olin, where I figured out in second year that I really liked brains, and Olin basically said, 'Okay, cool.  Well, convince us you're going to put together a curriculum that has enough, you know, depth and breadth to be comparable to other curriculums out there, that is about the brain.  Go.'  And I was able to do that.  And where there were courses that didn't make sense to me to redo, because I'd already had lots of background, I was able to argue for not redoing them and spending my time learning more complex, more specific stuff, um, that was a whole lot more useful to me.  

So I had a lot of control over using my time efficiently and effectively at Olin, which I appreciated tremendously.  Um, and having the flexibility to go to medical school, and at medical school, _____ [00:35:39] our medical school, I had a great deal of control over what specifically I was studying, um, and a lot of feedback along the way as to what things I needed to study more, how to balance all of my learning, et cetera, and so that was a lot of freedom.  Um, yeah.

Um, and it's really interesting to me too that the kids are still doing the work, and still, uh, you know, bought into the program even though we don't give them grades, um, there's not...like the only real feedback, structure that I know of to make them do things is, uh, by talking to their parents, and saying your kid's not doing things.  Um, but we try to a void that one anyway, and so, the idea of motivating exploration just through being in a classroom that's exciting and interesting, um, is, uh, pretty different from having to work really hard to get an A plus.

Um, for some reason I took what was going on in that class and I decided to combine it with my interest circuits and I, uh, as a final project spent a lot of time designing a circuit that would utilize, um, some of the concepts from the chaos theory and some of the concepts from, uh, communication theory and sort of, um, make the circuit.  So, I think now today I have a much stronger recall and, um, ability to use the basic building blocks from that class, um, that I probably would not have otherwise.  Like I'm sure if I've taken some other math elective, I think maybe I did, um, but I don't even remember it.  Um, like signals and system I don't think it was an elective, but I certainly just did not care much about that class, so I really don't remember anything from that class.  I don't remember how to do _____ [00:45:03] functions or impulse whatever stuff, um, but I do remember that chaos theory class and I do remember the _____ [00:45:10] that because of the work that I did when I was inspired to work on a project and investigate more on my own.

And so, you know, we kind of walked through what she might do to figure out the answer.

Um, well, it's hard to put into words, but I think, you know, I like to joke around with the kids and _____, [00:30:24] and, you know, really I kind of get those big concepts that, you know, science is, um, hands-on, and figure it out as its own type of field, and I try to, try to get the students to do, you know, come up with their own questions, then try to figure them out.  So, I'd like to say, you know, a little bit more exploratory education, so less, uh, me in the front and more about figuring out for, for themselves.  But, you know, certain topics, I do sometimes give them a meaning lecture - it's called that - and, you know, like, 'Here's what we're talking about, and these are the things we're going to be doing,' and I let them kind of ask their own questions and figure it out from there.  So, yeah.

So, uh, I, I think I did a lot of my own learning, uh, because I was kind of excited and passionate about the subject too, and so I kind of...I taught myself some things, and on my...um, I...so I ended up feeling pretty confident in the subject area.  So when my friends would have questions, they would come ask me first, and then if we didn't know it together, we would go ask the teacher, because she was hard to understand.  *laughs*  So I felt like, in that case, I did a lot of, you know...I was working through problems and helping my peers figure it out.  We kind of figured things out together.  Um, at Olin I felt like that happened sometimes.  I specifically remember a couple of times during freshman year...golly, I don't even remember what specifically we were working on, some kind of, uh, calc assignment.  And, uh, we just, you know, kind of buckled down, and we were working on it, and probably the, like in the dorm somewhere, we were, you know, discussed our problem with a _____ [00:57:15], so something, and they kind of helped a friend with it.

I think little things come, come here and there, like reading, um...you know, at Olin, for example, one of the, one of the things that I learned and took away from there that I've applied to, kind of, the tutoring that I do, like on the side, is spiral learning, and being like, just tossed a bunch of information and have them almost failing, like, a bunch of times, but every time you fail, you learn, and your mind kind of develops like a muscle, right?  You have to work it out, and if you're experiencing failure, then you're learning from those experiences and applying them for future experiences.  So, being able to actually, you know, 'fail' at something can actually help you accelerate your learning over the long term.

I try to help out - like, the people that I care about, like my younger sisters and my younger cousins - is do things that challenge you and make you...you know, going off of what I said earlier, being able to fail a little bit, but make your brain work so that you're challenged, and that's how you're going to develop more knowledge. 

P 4: 02-27-15-1 - Alexander.rtf - 4:46 [Hmm. I mean, I think so. Yeah...]  (184:190)   (Super)
Codes:  [success/failure]

Hmm.  I mean, I think so.  Yeah.  Just recently...you know, I tutor my, my stepsister on a lot of math courses.  And a previous semester, I made her kind of get into an accelerated math course, even though she didn't really want to, because I wanted her to challenge herself, because I thought she was, she would do well enough if, as long as she put the time and effort into it.  And, from my perspective, like, she just really wasn't putting the time and effort into it, and when we would tutor, we would kind of tangent off, talk about other topics, or, like, eat food or something, and we weren't really doing kind of the layout plan that I usually like to do, which is, like, review each section, have her talk me through everything, and do practice problems here and there. 

And so, for...you know, but my thought behind that was, I wanted her to own some responsibility, and, um, you know, let her know, like, this is kind of her life and her responsibility, how well she does in this class, how well she does in future classes, affects her ability to go and get into colleges and whatnot.  And that's something her dad has always tried to tell me too, is that, you know, he wants to give her a responsibility and let her make her own decisions, and I said, 'Okay, fine.  Like, I'll let her do that.'  And as a result she ended up getting a C that semester.  

And, you know, I did feel like I kind of failed them a bit, because I...it was kind of like you're...I was trying to convince her.  Like, 'Hey, you need to do more work.  You need to put more effort into this.  You need to make this more of a priority.'  But that approach kept not working, so, you know, I was just like, 'Fine.  I'll let you do...I'll be available, however much you want to tutor, I'll be here.  If you want to do more practice, I'm here, if you want to, you know, bounce ideas off of me.  But if you don't, if you want to cancel tutoring, whatever.'  You know, a bunch of times she canceled tutoring, and I was just, like, 'Okay, go ahead.'  I never thought she would get a C; she got, like, a C-plus, which is pretty crazy for that.  So, I mean, when she told me that she was getting a C and then got a C at the end, you know, I felt kind of like I failed a little bit.  But now that we're working past it, she's recognized and internalized that this is, like, her, you know, her effort and all her responsibility.  

So I feel like, hopefully, that's balanced it out, where now she's putting more effort and making, you know, schooling more a priority, and understands that challenging herself is good.  Because after she got a C, I was like, 'Hey, maybe you should just drop down to a lower course, if you don't want to put the time and effort into it.'  But she stuck it out, decided to keep, to stay in the challenging course, and now she's doing really well.  So, you know, maybe in the long term that played out, but definitely while it was happening, I felt like, man, I'm really disengaged, and I'm not really helping her grow.  And when she got a C, I was like, man, that's a reflection on me too, tutoring her.  So, I mean, I felt like a, I felt like I failed partly, but then, long-term I think it's going to be good.

I think the only thing I can think of that, um, kind of changed the way that I perceived, like, learning, or internalizing knowledge, was the fact that you, you like, work out your mind, as I mentioned earlier, through, like, challenging yourself more and even, like failing, than just doing something that you know you're good at, and doing it well.  So if you kind of push yourself and try to, you know, shoot for whatever, like 300 percent or something, even you get to 200 percent, maybe that's a fail to the 300 percent, but you got to 200 percent, when you would have never...you know, if you never pushed yourself, you would've only gotten to, like, 100 percent or something.  I don't if that's...that's not like an experience, but anyway...

[00:11:59]
I: Hmm, hmm.

P: But the teacher was, like, really chill about it and, like, didn't get upset when we didn't finish at the time we were supposed to, which was awesome.  Um, but, so, we...they were learning about light and so, um, like, the first of the weeks, I think it was, we, we, like, introduced the idea...like, had them start thinking about, like, 'Okay, like, how...have you seen 3D movies?  How do you think they work?  Like, what do 3D glasses look like?'  Um, and as soon as we, like, brought up, like, the topic of, like, just 3D stuff, they got really excited and the kids had, like, lots of questions, um, and it was really cool.  And so, at the end of...and so, we were going to have them, I think, like, build 3D glasses and then, like, draw a picture that they could actually see in 3D with the glasses they had just built.  Um, so, at the end of the first week, I think they had just built the glasses, and we didn't really get to, like, using them for anything.  Um, and then we went back the second week and we were trying to go into a little more depth.  Like, the typical sort of eDisco lesson structure is there will be, like, kind of a brief, like, 'Let's talk about the science' for, like, five, ten minutes and then you'll, like, do the activity, like, probably building something, and then there'll be, like, a wrap-up conclusion, like, tying it together.

I: Okay.

P: But, this is...we sort of...we talked about science first to prime them for, like, 'This is what your activity is related to and, like, what you're going to be learning as you go through the activity.'  Um, and so, in that beginning part, we were trying to go into a little more depth of, like, how, how, like, the different colored filters would block different things and, like, how does that work for your eyes getting two different images.  Um, and we were trying to kind of...we were trying to do this, like, exploratory thing where we were giving kids different colored crayons and we'd given them different...like, the colored filters, um, and we wanted them to kind of discover how it works, so, like, reason it out for themselves.  Um, but they just got really confused.  And, like, we tr-...we were guiding it but, like, it was just too big of a leap for them as sixth graders...

I: Hmm, hmm.

And, um...yeah, I think Andy, Andy ended up doing this, like, impromptu, like, demo thing where they were moving around the classroom representing light, and then mostly we just kind of told them how it worked and...because we were, like, 'This needs to just end and we need to get to the, like, fun part for you, the building,' because, like, they were done with it.

Like, it...my students just, like, did not learn kinematics from building these mousetrap cars, which they were supposed to.  Like, it was supposed to be, like...like, in my head it was going to be, like, like, mini lessons about kinematics maybe at the start of the period and then, like, applying that to their cars, because there was a whole...there was, like, there was a whole series of requirements where they had to do, like, experiments with their cars after they'd built them and they were supposed to be collecting data and then, like, calculating velocities and stuff like that...

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: That we were going to be learning about kinematics as they went along.  Um, but it, like, really didn't work out because they just, like...I just didn't do a good enough job of framing the requirements of the project to, like, make it clear that, like, the part about experimenting and, like, learning the kinematics was, like, also important and equally valuable and so, like, what ended up happening is mostly they just spent a whole lot of time tinkering with their cars and making really cool mousetrap cars and, like, learning valuable engineering lessons about, like, trying lots of ideas and working together in groups and, like, iterating on their ideas and, like, being persistent, like, all of that was great.

Um, I think some of it was trial and error.  Uh, me starting out at times as a teacher trying to teach in the way that I taught this or that I learned this.

Um, let me think of one I can share.  So, there's this girl who sits near me in the office, and she's constantly asking me, who do I call for this?  Who do I, you know, ask for this?  Who do I do this?  And, uh, we have a shared resource, a wiki page, that lists all of those people by office, and it would answer every single one of her questions.  And, uh, I have tried answering her with names off of the wiki page and citing the wiki page so she knows where it came from.  I have tried sending her the wiki page directly and trying to get her to use to fish for herself.  I have sent it, you know, in chat.  I have sent in email.  And I've had other people send it to her.  I've had her bookmark it in her browser.  Um, I've...you know, when she's asked me a question, I've told her, just go to the wiki page.  And she's one of those people who...that's simply not how she chooses to learn.  She's very in denial that she has to know this information and that she needs to use this information, and that I can't be this constant source for that information.  

Um, and so, as it just so happens, she and I got into a fight one day.  That's something completely different, and I'm okay with this.  And, uh, I did my side of the making up, and she just never cared to do hers, so she just won't talk to me.  And I'm cool with that right now, because she's actually kind of being a bitch.  And, uh...but the side effect is that she won't ask me for the questions...she won't ask me for answers, and so then she has to ask our incompetent teammate, and our incompetent teammate can't answer because he's incompetent.  And so what does she do?  She's like, 'Oh, crap.  What resources do I have at my disposal to answer this?'  *laughs*  And, so, uh, apparently she's the kind of person who just learns because she has no better option.  She finally started to use the resource that's been provided and understand that it's part of her job to do that, when it's a last resort.  And it's...I felt like that was one of my non-successes at teaching.  In the end, she finally learned, but I was not successful at teaching that, because she just had absolutely no interest whatsoever in learning.  

Um, whereas, I had a different co-worker who need the same resource, and I passed it to him once, and now he uses it religiously.  He can't believe he didn't know about this resource before.  It is gold for him, and, um, so the wiki page is, like, his magic treasure, and he's so appreciative that I gave it to him.  And it's that the desire to learn was so important, and I felt frustrated with myself as a teacher for not being able to teach my bitch of a co-worker, and, um, and now I feel that it really, to some extent, in that specific case, it wasn't necessarily my fault.  *laughs*  I'm not letting myself off the hook.  There's certainly other places where it has been my fault that I haven't been effective in teaching people, but, um, anyway...

I'm, like, well I must be doing something right, because I don't even think I'm testing super well.  Um, but you know, I really felt like I pulled a lot out of my graduate education.  And it's not something that was taught to me, it's not something they made any effort to convey, but I made the most of it,  because Olin helped me understand that learning is important.

I did really, really poorly, um...okay.  That's an understatement.  In, in high school physics -- mechanics, specifically -- um, there just was so much to teach that they actually took a whole year just for mechanics, um, and then a whole year for E and M.  And, uh, and even then, they just, they mostly just taught, kind of, elementary ideas about how everything applied.  And then, based on this elementary idea, please, you know, just simply memorize this formula.  Um, and so I don't think I had a good concept of mechanics from high school, even though I did perfectly fine in the class, and I did perfectly fine on my AP exam.  

And then we come to a physics/mechanics, first semester, freshman year at Olin, and I still had this pretty crappy foundation, and I appreciated that they were still trying to help you understand, um, but I guess the way that a physicist comes at things just isn't how I learn.  Um, and they were still teaching it like a physics class.  They were still teaching it the way you teach it as a science.  You now, here's the scientific method.  We tested it.  Here's what we found, you know, based on refuting various hypotheses.  And here's the mathematical derivation as one of these axioms and laws.  Oh, okay.  It just...nothing was clicking for me.

I don't, I don't think so.  I think little things come, come here and there, like reading, um...you know, at Olin, for example, one of the, one of the things that I learned and took away from there that I've applied to, kind of, the tutoring that I do, like on the side, is spiral learning, and being like, just tossed a bunch of information and have them almost failing, like, a bunch of times, but every time you fail, you learn, and your mind kind of develops like a muscle, right?  You have to work it out, and if you're experiencing failure, then you're learning from those experiences and applying them for future experiences.  So, being able to actually, you know, 'fail' at something can actually help you accelerate your learning over the long term.  

So, I mean, I think from that perspective, that's kind of developed, and then...let's see if there was anything else that changed my perception of learning.  I mean, my sister is a teacher, um, and she has been for, like seven...no, almost 10 years now.  So, you know, just talking with her, she's always been kind of a born teacher and has, kind of...I think she's had a lot of influence on me too, in terms of the education aspect, on really opinionated ways of how teachers in America and stuff should be, versus, you know, how maybe the current state is.  So, for her, being able to share some of her stories and things that she does in her classrooms to really facilitate better education, whether it's, you know, making sure that there's enough breaks in between so that the children don't get, or the kids don't get, like, overwhelmed by a certain topic, or they don't spin off into, uh, stop paying attention.  Or how she splits them up into smaller groups to spur more conversation and participation from each person.  You know, things like that, so I feel like, um, it's not necessarily one experience, but it's just, you know, teaching's kind of developing from there.

P: Um, and sort of overtime at Olin, I think, by most...like, by living a different definition of teaching, both as a student and, like, in eDisco, it kind of evolved into more of...like, 'Teachers guide students in the right direction,' I think, was kind of, like, a stepping stone.  Um, like, for a while, I probably would have said teaching is about, like, guiding students, um, or, like, asking questions that get students to where you want them to be.  Um, and then, like, my thought about, like, teachers as designers of learning experiences, I think that kind of came...I mean, that kind of became my definition, like, in my junior year at Olin.  Like, I took UOCD and then the next semester I was taking this education class at Wellesley and we were supposed to do, like, action research and we had, like, field placements in Boston, and I realized that, like, a lot of what my teacher was telling us to do as, like, researchers, like, to do for our action research project was, like, the same things we'd been doing in UOCD just, like, with different words.  *laughs*  Like, she was using totally different words to describe it, but it was, like, the same.

Um, and there wasn't a whole lot of mentorship there especially because I don't think the teachers there had a whole lot of training.  I did get some recommendations, but I don't think it was particularly well informed, or, um, yeah.  I don't think the pedagogy there was particularly interesting, or advanced.  Um, and then, um, since then, I was just doing tutoring and one on one education which is totally different from classroom teaching, uh, and I think a lot more intuitive, and so, again, I was just making it up, and doing my best until getting this job, and in this job, I've been just incredibly, just bombarded from all sides by old teaching methods, and new teaching methods, um, the alternative teaching methods, just all sorts of, um, teaching methods, instruction, and, uh, one of the thing recently that increased that is a, uh, ILC, Innovative Learning Conference goes on at the school that I teach at, um, and the Innovative Learning Conference is a whole bunch of people presenting on research, or, uh, just workshops, and ideas, um, all about ways to teach, uh, that are  new, and not necessarily better or worse, or maybe better for some things, and worse for others, but conferences like that have been really amazing.  Uh, I also went to the ISTE, something about technology, and education, I forget what the conference acronym stands for, um, last year, and also there was Design Thinking Institute which is later over the summer to teach other educators how to teach design thinking, um, and so, I was sort of taking the two last year as a student sort of learning tech and support for, um, and I'll be leading one of the rooms this year.

So I really like to know who needs the teaching, who's doing the learning, um, in order to understand how this knowledge should be transferred.  I think that's even more evident nowadays.  I happened to take a language and an adult education class at the local high school, and I see them teaching us the same way they teach the high schoolers, and it's, it's just so not effective.  *laughs*  I mean, you've got to kind of learn that adults learn a little differently than children, and that different adults learn differently from others, like different kids learn differently.

And, um, I'm trying to figure out why, and I realized it's because, you know, they've come to me with similar questions, and I didn't take the time to redo my teaching methods, um, to match their needs.  And, so over the last eight years or so of being a person in the working environment who spends a fair amount of time trying to transfer knowledge to other coworkers, I've really...again, I learned the hard way, and now I'm doing a much better job at, uh, trying to understand how people best learn individually, and then using that to transfer knowledge.

Hmm, I'm trying to think of another example besides just tutoring.  Um, you know, one of the things in my workplace that were, that we have is like a mentorship program.  And, it allows employees to go, you know, to your mentor for pretty much anything that you need, like, guidance on, or something.  In fact, just this morning, I was working with a colleague who I oversee a project on, and she was asking me, like, professional development advice on, on certain things.  And, you know, giving her...being able to give her some feedback without necessarily telling her advice...like, I feel like there's a fine line, right?

P 4: 02-27-15-1 - Alexander.rtf - 4:48 [Hmm. I mean, I think so. Yeah...]  (184:188)   (Super)
Codes:  [teaching model - enact]

Hmm.  I mean, I think so.  Yeah.  Just recently...you know, I tutor my, my stepsister on a lot of math courses.  And a previous semester, I made her kind of get into an accelerated math course, even though she didn't really want to, because I wanted her to challenge herself, because I thought she was, she would do well enough if, as long as she put the time and effort into it.  And, from my perspective, like, she just really wasn't putting the time and effort into it, and when we would tutor, we would kind of tangent off, talk about other topics, or, like, eat food or something, and we weren't really doing kind of the layout plan that I usually like to do, which is, like, review each section, have her talk me through everything, and do practice problems here and there. 

And so, for...you know, but my thought behind that was, I wanted her to own some responsibility, and, um, you know, let her know, like, this is kind of her life and her responsibility, how well she does in this class, how well she does in future classes, affects her ability to go and get into colleges and whatnot.  And that's something her dad has always tried to tell me too, is that, you know, he wants to give her a responsibility and let her make her own decisions, and I said, 'Okay, fine.  Like, I'll let her do that.'  And as a result she ended up getting a C that semester.  

And, you know, I did feel like I kind of failed them a bit, because I...it was kind of like you're...I was trying to convince her.  Like, 'Hey, you need to do more work.  You need to put more effort into this.  You need to make this more of a priority.'  But that approach kept not working, so, you know, I was just like, 'Fine.  I'll let you do...I'll be available, however much you want to tutor, I'll be here.  If you want to do more practice, I'm here, if you want to, you know, bounce ideas off of me.  But if you don't, if you want to cancel tutoring, whatever.'  You know, a bunch of times she canceled tutoring, and I was just, like, 'Okay, go ahead.'  I never thought she would get a C; she got, like, a C-plus, which is pretty crazy for that.  So, I mean, when she told me that she was getting a C and then got a C at the end, you know, I felt kind of like I failed a little bit.  But now that we're working past it, she's recognized and internalized that this is, like, her, you know, her effort and all her responsibility.

Um, yeah.  I'm jumping around topic a lot.  Another thing that I actually do is, and this is only recently, um, but, uh, there's a thing called the Literacy Project here, which is just like, you go in, and you read with, um, elementary school kids, uh, when I was doing it I realized that, um, most of the  students that I'm reading with, because you go in, and you...there's like a teacher for the classroom, and usually she'll just ask you to go off to the side and practice reading with one of the kids, uh, or maybe take like five of them, and most of them are, uh, English is their second language, and they don't necessarily speak it that well.  It varies, but, um, the reason that you're helping them is ‘cause they're kind of behind the class.  Uh, and I can remember, uh, like I was working with kindergarteners that day, and most of the kindergarteners like, they'll take between like 10 or 15 minutes to finish the portion that they're supposed to read with me.  Uh, but I was working with this one kid, and she was so slow, it was really cute, like a kindergartener, um, and I forget the word, but it was the same exact word, it was 'surprise.'  Every single time, she would mess up the word surprise, and it's...because I'm so much older now, and like, like, I've read for so long, uh, to really identify with like, um, how hard reading can be, because sometimes I'm so amazed by it.  Uh, but, like, literally the structure of the story was like, it's a surprise party for the main character, whatever.  So, like, oh, what's in that pot, it's a big surprise, what's in that bag, it's a big surprise.  So, every page has the word surprise, and every page she would stumble over it.  Uh, it took so long to get through that, and then next week she had to read it again, and it took so long to get that.  Uh, but the third week, it went a lot faster.  Uh, and I guess like, some like, really negative part of me is like, thank God, it's about time, but the somewhat more positive of me was like, oh, like, yeah.  Finally we made progress, you know, like, you just like, hitting this thing, and eventually, like, you, I don't know, you keep pushing this huge boulder, and eventually it moves, and like maybe you never thought it would.  So, it's really I guess fulfilling to see that happen, and like I mean, she was really happy too.  So, I think that's pretty fulfilling.

I got really frustrated with my students sometimes because, um, and I always try to put this in perspective, but like, for me, it felt like they weren't trying very hard, um, and they expected me to spoon feed them, like answers to the test or something, or like if they were struggling with their homework for me to do like, talk it out to them, um, and I guess like the way that I learned, and the way that I think is better to learn is that sort of more open ended prodding, of like, pushing them to explore, and also, pushing them to, I don't know, push their knowledge for the sake  of knowledge.  Like...it doesn't really align with everybody's perspective, uh, and that's fine too, uh, but I guess I found that frustrating.  I found like, if I'd been carrying a lot of this class, and they didn't...I found that, uh, frustrating, and again, I mentioned earlier, I have a hard time leading groups of people, uh, and so, and these are like college freshmen too, so  they're gonna be like immature sometimes.  Uh, I just found that whole class difficult, and, um, there was a student with a learning disability in my class, and he was, like his personality was super sweet like, when you just talked to him, but he made me cry so many times, but not in class, but like, after it, I would just go out, and cry for a bit.  Uh, because he...I'm not really sure, uh, what it was, but he would talk a lot during class, uh, and he would get really emotional, and like, if he didn't understand things, or like, things didn't quite work out well for him in the lab, or something.  It was really hard for me to like, try to stay patient, like, okay, its okay, we'll do this over again.  Like, okay, lower your voice. Very emotionally draining, or like, when I'm working with one student and he just interrupts me, or something.  I don't know.  I'm...I don't know how to deal with things like that.  I'm a very like, introverted, uh, quiet person.  So, being bombarded with so many students who had so many expectations of me, and like, who I also felt like, weren't really trying, it was a miserable experience.

So, um, for some classes I think they require much more help, but for the classes that I did there, it was very like, they kind of used you as an idea soundboard which is actually fine.

Like, what is the direct approach to it, um, or they think like, in my mind a lot of people get caught on tangents and stuff, um, and then, they like, get into these little loops of like, how do I solve this part.  Um, but just being able to oh well, we'll do this, and somehow it will work out, and then we'll go over here, and  somehow it'll work out, and this is obviously the next step that would follow after that.  So, just being like very, like direct, enabled, like cut things down to bare bones structure, and then build up again from there.

Codes:  [peer teaching] [success/failure] [teaching model - enact]

Um, let me think of one I can share.  So, there's this girl who sits near me in the office, and she's constantly asking me, who do I call for this?  Who do I, you know, ask for this?  Who do I do this?  And, uh, we have a shared resource, a wiki page, that lists all of those people by office, and it would answer every single one of her questions.  And, uh, I have tried answering her with names off of the wiki page and citing the wiki page so she knows where it came from.  I have tried sending her the wiki page directly and trying to get her to use to fish for herself.  I have sent it, you know, in chat.  I have sent in email.  And I've had other people send it to her.  I've had her bookmark it in her browser.  Um, I've...you know, when she's asked me a question, I've told her, just go to the wiki page.  And she's one of those people who...that's simply not how she chooses to learn.  She's very in denial that she has to know this information and that she needs to use this information, and that I can't be this constant source for that information.  

Um, and so, as it just so happens, she and I got into a fight one day.  That's something completely different, and I'm okay with this.  And, uh, I did my side of the making up, and she just never cared to do hers, so she just won't talk to me.  And I'm cool with that right now, because she's actually kind of being a bitch.  And, uh...but the side effect is that she won't ask me for the questions...she won't ask me for answers, and so then she has to ask our incompetent teammate, and our incompetent teammate can't answer because he's incompetent.  And so what does she do?  She's like, 'Oh, crap.  What resources do I have at my disposal to answer this?'  *laughs*  And, so, uh, apparently she's the kind of person who just learns because she has no better option.  She finally started to use the resource that's been provided and understand that it's part of her job to do that, when it's a last resort.  And it's...I felt like that was one of my non-successes at teaching.  In the end, she finally learned, but I was not successful at teaching that, because she just had absolutely no interest whatsoever in learning.  

Um, whereas, I had a different co-worker who need the same resource, and I passed it to him once, and now he uses it religiously.  He can't believe he didn't know about this resource before.  It is gold for him, and, um, so the wiki page is, like, his magic treasure, and he's so appreciative that I gave it to him.  And it's that the desire to learn was so important, and I felt frustrated with myself as a teacher for not being able to teach my bitch of a co-worker, and, um, and now I feel that it really, to some extent, in that specific case, it wasn't necessarily my fault.  *laughs*  I'm not letting myself off the hook.  There's certainly other places where it has been my fault that I haven't been effective in teaching people, but, um, anyway...

Um, most of those end up being, I think, serendipitous.  Um, I find that I can do something that someone else can't, and they ask me for help and I show them.  And then they tell someone else, um, kind of through the grapevine, and then I'll have this kind of stream of people who all want to learn the same thing.  And if it's super easy, then I can just teach a stream of people together.  Um, and in some of the more complex cases, I put together a little course, and I'll do something like a practicum, where I bring together the slides, and everyone comes and brings their laptop or whatnot, and we all practice together, um, to learn the material.  So people get to choose whichever they learn best.  You know, they can just listen, they can watch/read the slides, they can try it themselves, whatever.   And those are some of the ones that have ended up working the best.  

There was one time when my company was rolling out Microsoft Office 2007, and that was a big change from 2003, right?  They introduced the ribbon, and all these other new features, and you get a lot of people in their 50s and 60s who just never cared to learn how to use computers independently.  Um, so they don't...they get something new, and they don't just click around and try things.  They don't say, 'Well, what does this do?  What does this do?'  I mean, read the help _____. [01:02:19].  They're just like, 'Oh, God!' and they freeze, um, and so that happened to be a very effective class on Microsoft Office 2007.  And, um, I've done a lot more of those at work on topics that I can't share, but, you know, you just, you become the office expert on something, and people ask for your help.

Um, so I, um, she's gotten one for Christmas and I...like they had just tuned it and she had no idea how to play it and no one else did, um, including myself, so I looked it up on Google and, um, I think, you know, I think she's like eight...eight years old.  The only difference between her looking it up on the Internet and me is that I think that it's easy for me to look at several sources of information pretty quickly, um, discern what's useful and valuable, understand the audience and help her to find the most interesting bits.  So, if she were to Google how do I play the violin she might work with web pages and be discouraged.

Interviewer:

Yeah.

Greg:

So, if I Google, you know, 80 songs to play the violin or _____ [00:20:16] for the violin which is something that she might not think of.  I could easily find Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, you know, I could learn how to play that really quickly by just reading and I can help, you know, take the, um, take the information that's on the page, uh, either explain it to her and display it on the page or I can use my understanding of what her situation is which is being, you know, eight years old and not necessarily able to fully understand what's being described on the page, so I can explain it a different way.

Hmm.  Um, for a while I was volunteering at the...there were some citizenship classes, um, over here at Catholic Charities  in Fort Worth, um, in say helping students who are already green card holders, um, study for, prepare for and pass the immigration test.  Um, it's interesting there are only 100 questions on possible on that test, um, so it's actually possible to just memorize all 100 answers.  Uh [Chuckles]...

Interviewer:

Okay.

Greg:

But, uh, what we did in his classes was actually go through and teach engaging, you know, history lessons.  Um, so that way [Chuckles] I guess, you know, you're more likely to learn and remember and perhaps you use the information if you have it taught to you, um, through a class than just being given a list of questions and answers.

Interviewer:

Um, is there a particular lesson that you can remember that you really enjoyed teaching or something like that?

You're so proud.  *laughs*  So, it was like a high-school level course of physics, but taught to 5th graders.

And, uh, I remember being on a ride with a group of my students, and as we were going up the hill, they were like, 'Potential!  Potential!  Potential!'  As we were gaining potential up, energy on the way up, and then we were going down, they were like, 'Kinetic!'  [Both laugh]  So, I mean, clearly it sunk in for them, so I was proud of them, and I think, you know, it was a good...so it was one of my favorite moments from that.

And, um, 6th grade is an interesting time because it's the first time they've really learned about the scientific method and, you know, changing variables in an experiment.  So I try to get them to think a little bit beyond a very, like, cut and dry activity and try to get them to say, like, 'Well, what part do we change?' or 'What if we did it this way instead?  How would that be different?'  Um, so, and just to try to get them to ask questions.  And, you know, I tell them, 'Sometimes I don't know the answers either, and, you know we're all learning together,' and I try to get them excited about looking things up on their own and...yeah, I don't know.  *laughs*  So...

So I can think of a specific example of something she would ask me.  Um, we were talking about galaxies and gravity, and she was saying, like, 'Oh, well, if two galaxies are near each other, what would happen?'  And I was like, 'Okay, well, what do you think would happen?  How would that manifest?  What would happen?'  And she's like, 'Well, gravity means that the masses want to come together, so probably they would start forming into one another,' and I was, like, 'Well, you're certainly on the right path.  Like, what do you think...how would you find the answer to this?  What would happen?'

So, I'd like to say, you know, a little bit more exploratory education, so less, uh, me in the front and more about figuring out for, for themselves.  But, you know, certain topics, I do sometimes give them a meaning lecture - it's called that - and, you know, like, 'Here's what we're talking about, and these are the things we're going to be doing,' and I let them kind of ask their own questions and figure it out from there.

Oh, now that's a really deep question.  *laughs*  Um, I think one of the most powerful things that I'm going to try to do - and I haven't had the opportunity to do this so much - is to really let the girls in my class know that they can be successful in science and/or math, or whatever.  And I was hoping - I haven't quite developed it _____ [01:17:54] yet, but I'm hoping to develop a...like a science biography report, where students are...I haven't quite figured out if they're assigned or if they get to choose, or how that's worked, but they get a scientist they get to look into and figure out what achievements they've got, and, you know, how they've thought about science and learning and all those things.  Um, and my goal is to have many women and many people of color and just all different kinds of backgrounds, to let all students know that, like, 'Hey, this person who looks like me and who acts like me,' you know, whatever, was able to be this famous scientist.  

And I think, you know, that's a really powerful message.  And I think that, you know, unfortunately, not as many, not as many women, not as many scientists of color are talked about in science.  And, you know, we get all those, the famous old, the white guys _____ [01:19:14].  And I think, you know, that...just empowering, you just don't realized that, uh, there are people like that who have been successful.  It's maybe not, uh, maybe not enough, but maybe the start, so, uh, yeah.  I think there's a whole lot I need to think about in terms, in gender, and it's hard, because in 6th grade, they're just starting their, like, real science education, and, I mean, that's a perfect opportunity to teach these kids to think, but it's also hard to make it last.  You know, how do I make what they learn and experience affect them six years on, or whatever, when they're applying for college.  You know, it's crazy things that they _____ [01:20:12] out, so... *laughs*  I don't know.

Codes:  [teaching model - express]

To me, I think of teaching as...well, I come from, like, a lot of tutoring background, and I've been a tutor for a long time, so to me, teaching is leading someone to a concept or an idea, um, with either poignant questions or giving them direction so that they can come to a conclusion of whatever you're trying to get them to figure on their own, and then having them have that, like, you know, light bulb kind of a factor or thought thing.  You know, ding, I get it now.  Versus, like, 'Here, let me write down, um, the solve this, like, quadratic equation, and go ahead and do it.  I just showed you how to do it; does it make sense?'  'Oh, yeah, it kind of, it makes sense.'  But really it didn't...you didn't teach them to do it; you just showed them how to do it.  Is that good enough?

Or how she splits them up into smaller groups to spur more conversation and participation from each person.  You know, things like that, so I feel like, um, it's not necessarily one experience, but it's just, you know, teaching's kind of developing from there.

Codes:  [teaching model - express]

Yeah.  Well, I mean, I guess in that sense, I think, you know, a teacher is just someone who has, to me, the ability to communicate messages that actually get through to whoever is receiving them, in a meaningful way.  So that person is receiving whatever message, actually internalizes it, versus just sees it, hears it, understands it, and then forgets it.  Um, so, I mean, you know, like, in tutoring, I always try to either have a lot of, what's it called...I either ask really directed questions, or I have, when they ask me questions that I know they know the answer to, I just sit there in silence, and then let them figure it out.  And then eventually they figure it out.  So, I mean, those are more attributes of a teacher; um, I mean, in my opinion, attributes of the tutor.  In terms of like, uh, education, like in an institution or something, I feel like the teacher should be able to, I don't know, have something that challenges.

That's another big thing that is important to me in my life, in anything I do, in anything, you know, I try to help out - like, the people that I care about, like my younger sisters and my younger cousins - is do things that challenge you and make you...you know, going off of what I said earlier, being able to fail a little bit, but make your brain work so that you're challenged, and that's how you're going to develop more knowledge.  Um, so, being able to push yourself, challenge yourself, with...you know, maybe take that harder course.  Yeah, maybe you get a B or something, but that B is equivalent to, you know...is way more valuable in the long term, versus getting in, like, an easy class or something.

Here's something, you know, that may work in your situation.  Here are some of the pros and cons.  Like, what do you think about that?'  And then allowing them to internalize that and pick something that's good for them.  So, like, a lot of that kind of overlaps.  You know, there's a fine line between telling, giving someone advice and, you know, telling them.  You know, giving them certain options, more like an education-focused approach, versus, 'Oh, this is definitely what you should do.'

I think the only thing I can think of that, um, kind of changed the way that I perceived, like, learning, or internalizing knowledge, was the fact that you, you like, work out your mind, as I mentioned earlier, through, like, challenging yourself more and even, like failing, than just doing something that you know you're good at, and doing it well.  So if you kind of push yourself and try to, you know, shoot for whatever, like 300 percent or something, even you get to 200 percent, maybe that's a fail to the 300 percent, but you got to 200 percent, when you would have never...you know, if you never pushed yourself, you would've only gotten to, like, 100 percent or something.

I mean, in terms of, you know, that type of concept of spiral learning, um, my sister, like, showing me different things about making sure you're taking intermittent breaks between certain things, because people can't handle so much information.  Um, on the efforts of challenging yourself and, I think, one other thing that I've more internalized recently is, um, having people communicate back to you what you think they heard, or what you think they understood.  So, like, if I'm explaining a concept, or if a teacher is teaching, you know, teaching me something, I'd say, 'Oh, yeah, I get it.'  Um, you know, me being able to reiterate exactly what it is, and then saying, 'Oh, yes, that's it,' or 'No, that's not,' and then, 'Let's fix it.'

Codes:  [teaching model - express]

I mean, I think I considered it, um, but what I really enjoy more is one-on-one interactions and my kind of more in-depth interactions.  Um, and I felt like teaching, you're always dealing with a...at least in secondary education, you're always dealing with, in high school there are, like, always 30 kids now, and most colleges have huge classrooms of people.  And you're not really, in those scenarios, you're almost not really, by my definition, as I mentioned earlier, you're not really teaching.  You're more showing, explaining as best you can, but there's no back and forth dialogue necessarily, or it's impossible to have back and forth dialogue with every single individual on a personal basis to make sure that they're actually internalizing what you're doing.  And to me, that would be too, almost like depressing.  Yeah, you're kind of showing concepts, and you're teaching things at, at a high level, and maybe some people will get it, but the truth is, some people really won't get it.  And that would, you know, kind of suck, because I would know that there's no way there'd be enough time for me to individually meet with every single person and, you know, explain certain things.  

So, like, what I get most happiness about on the tutoring and mentoring side is it's really personal.  It's really one on one.  It's really customized education, fit to that person, so you're almost taken into the...you have to take into account, like, their quirks, what works for them, if you have to be more lenient, if you have to be, more stringent on certain things, if you have to take a certain approach.  You know, for example, you always...I always give a lot of examples in either tutoring or, like, mentoring on, you know, something's that worked for me.  So you have to pull from...you know, you have a huge, vast pool of examples, and you have to pull the one that's going to fit into some interest of that person and make them understand it.  Or, um, pull one that's something that they, I don't know, are...I guess, what I said earlier; it interests them, so then they're going to be able to understand it.

Um, I think going into thermo, I didn't necessarily have, like, a lot of expectations about the class or, like, I didn't...I wasn't uninterested, like, it was physics.  Like, I thought I would like it.  But I also didn't really have any particular passion for the subject.  Um...

Hmm.  I think, to be a teacher, you have to figure out what is the best way to help whoever you are learning, learn, whether that is getting them to figure things out for themselves, whether that is doing more classic lecture-style teaching, small-group teaching, et cetera.  I think a lot of it is about being able to gauge your audience, um, and teach in the way that is going to maximize their learning with the constraints that you have.  Sometimes you can't do the kind of teaching you want to do; if you've got 35 6th-graders, you are bouncing everywhere.

Well, some of it is being...I always lean first towards people figuring things out for themselves as much as I think I can.  Um, so obviously if I'm teaching someone brain surgery for the first time, I'm not going to say, 'Here's a rat.  Put this piece of metal into its brain,' because that's not a really fair level of teaching.  But based on how much I knew he was comfortable with animals to start with, I could sort of say, 'Okay, you've done this sort of injection before.  This one is like this other sort of injection.  Try it.'  I might hear a few final questions, versus other parts, where he's never done anything like it before.  I would say, 'Okay, you know, you don't have any background in this.  Let me show you one, and then you're going to try one.'  So it's very judgment-based on how much I know how much background they have, and what are the potential ramifications if they can't figure it out or can't do it right.

Codes:  [teaching model - express]

If it's a more traditional, lecture-based learning experience, I definitely have some expectation that the teacher has pre-thought about the best or most or at least an effective way to communicate the information.  For instance, I have some graduate classes now that are kind of terrible, because the professor is just giving a stream of consciousness on their topic, you know, whatever their research specialty is, and it doesn't actually end up transmitting very much information because of the disorganized mess of whatever they happen to be thinking.  Um...

P 6: 02-27-15-1 - Grace.rtf - 6:62 [For instance, we were supposed..]  (318:320)   (Super)

For instance, we were supposed to learn about no anatomy as it relates to no implants, and the professor comes in and _____ [00:31:59] on the organization of brain, peripheral nervous system, nerve stuff, um, and you've got in, you know, like the little mannequin has got a...that has nerves coming out of its spinal, uh, out of his backbone, but he starts going; he says, 'Well, uh, you know, so I guess we're going to start with talking about the brain, because that's what's on my slide, so you can put neuroelectrodes into various parts of the brain, but you know, there's actually this other really cool electrode that you can use in the brain, but you can also use in the peripheral nervous system, and when you insert it like this, it causes this dye, you know, sort of platinum, radium component to come off, and so, in the peripheral nervous system, you basically just...' and it goes on and on like that, in sort of a twisting, tortuous path.  It doesn't actually end up either letting us figure something out for ourselves, which would have been totally fine, or communicating the information that he knows in an organized fashion.  

Um, I'm totally fine with the self-teaching, figure things out, but if you're going to try and lecture, I mean, it's very frustrating when it's not...if it's...when it's not from one who's thought about any useful way to teach.  As opposed to, say, um, my MBA, because it was primarily a teaching-focused school, they put a lot of thought into a really time-effective, efficient way to communicate a lot of information.  Um, and certainly there was some lecture component, but there was also a lot of pre-planned, built-in, small group experience that helped get the point of the lecture across, that made sense in the context of the organization of the course.  They just did a good job of using people's time efficiently, versus maybe not so much in some of these upper level graduate courses I'm taking now.

Um, for me right now it means, uh, guiding, and exploration, um, and providing some sort of framework that is not too specific, not so specific that it's, um, uh, prescribing a particular set of experiences that a student feels like they have no choice, um, or that they, uh, are  just going through motions that are prescribed to them because that's what particularly good for learning, but in order to facilitate that learning experiences, uh, if you just put a bunch of materials, whether they're learning materials, or physical materials, or whatever in front of a student, and say, go, uh, often there's not much learning that can go on either because they don't know what to do, and they're not always, uh, self-assured enough to ask the right questions.  It's, uh, structuring and guiding that, uh, and inspiring as well that, uh, exploration just enough, um, to keep up the, uh, sort of intrinsically, sort of a funny nothing to say inspiring the intrinsic motivation, um, but of students, um, and then, removing some road blocks, but not all of them.  Um, that's something that I'm sort of figuring out these days is which ones to, uh, which  answers to get out, which, uh, and what hints to give because if you just give an answer, you can sort of assume that the student hasn't really learned anything, um, but if instead you can structure it in a way that they have to think about it, and figure it out, whatever parts they think about, and figure out, they might actually be learning something.  Um, so, it's creating those opportunities for experimentations.

Um, I think it means a lot.  I mean, like when someone doesn't understand something, you really have to dive into why that is, and it could be that they're missing out on a lot of like fundamental knowledge, and so, there are gaps.  Um, like study groups before you were trying to teach the subject that you were actually supposed to pursue.  I think that so many people think very, very differently, and so, it's hard to adapt your mind set to what another person could be.  So, you need that flexibility of thought process.  You need to keep that open mind, uh, which isn't necessarily how things have to be.  Um, I think part of it is being inspiring, and encouraging, and having that positive reinforcement that keeps someone coming back to try again, even if they fail, uh, because that is what a lot of learning is. I think as a teacher too, I guess it depends on what sort of situation you're in, but I think that there's a lot of good that you can do, but there's also, when you have so many students, um, maybe, I don't know.  Also to be able to accept that it's not always gonna work out, and your ability to help everybody.  Um, but maybe rather take pleasure in the students that you do help.

Uh, I know that Like, I've gone back, and written e-mails to professors at Olin, being like, I don't know what I'm doing with my life, could you please just give me some suggestion.  Um, and they've been really nice about that, and very helpful, um, but also, like not...I don't think teaching should ever be like this is what you do.  Step 1 is this, Step 2 is this, don't question why, just do it.  Um, I think that that's true, like for specific knowledge like chemistry, and I think it's probably true for like I don't know what career path I should take where they're just like, well, here are a few things to think about, but ultimately the decision, and how you do things is like up to you.  I think that that's very, very crucial for teaching.

Okay.  Um, personally, and I know this isn't shared by everyone, but personally I like to lump all the like things together, the things that to me intrinsically are the same concepts that we've found semantic differences for, depending on context.  So, to me, I like...I do think that teaching, training, educating, um, can all fall in the same broad definition category, if you're going to talk about them without context.  I like to think of it as the transference of knowledge from one body to another, but I don't know that that knowledge takes any specific form.  I think that Olin did a great job of teaching knowledge through doing, and teaching knowledge through collaboration, where a lot of primary schools try to teach knowledge through reading and dictation, memorization.  Um, in my current work, I think of teaching as training and educating along the lines of teaching someone to fish, right?  Teaching them skills that they need to have to do their job.  

Now, I also see teaching, as a transference of knowledge that doesn't have to be complete.  We're such an Internet-based society now, that people don't necessarily know the specific fact, but they know exactly what words to type into, you know, a search engine to find that information.  Um, I appreciate that.  It's the same idea, I guess, as not learning and memorizing facts and formulas, it's an open-book test.  And I do that same thing at work.  I teach my coworkers to go look at resources that either exist from someone else's doing, or that I have produced, so that they don't constantly need to ask; um, they can go and seek for themselves.  So, yeah, that transference of knowledge is really the essence, in my mind.

But, I'd like to think of a teacher or a trainer or an educator as anyone who's doing that transference of knowledge, who's facilitating that.  Um, and I generally think of an ineffective teacher as someone who hasn't figured out how their student learns, and an effective teacher as someone who uses the way that their student learns the most effectively to transfer that knowledge quickly and completely and in a way where the student willing accepted it.

Are they the person who wants to turn by landmarks, or are they the person who wants to turn by street names?  I have no idea.  My husband is geographically challenged and wants the landmarks...or, excuse me; he's geographically challenged and wants the street names.  Um, I happen to like landmarks, and I know there's, you know, other people who like counting.

You're wasting my time, and you're not respecting the fact that I have already learned this because you asked me to.  Um, there are...it's this contract, if you will, between the student and the teacher, that you're both valuable, and you both have something to bring to the table, whether it's a desire to learn, or a desire to share the information, and I just, I want to see that respected.

And so, is that how you ended up teaching, with hands-on aspects, or...yeah?

Yeah.  As much as, as much as I could, and trying to get, you know, little projects or bigger projects for the classrooms that, uh, trying to get the kids, as much as they can, doing science instead of just, you know, learning science.  Like, doing it is how you learn stuff.

Uh, well, I think...I mean, I don't know how that's the thing, but I think doing it, you know, you really, uh, remember things when you've experienced that first-hand.  And so I think, uh, like, you can say, 'Well, this happens every time you do that,' and some people might believe you, but if you actually let the kid experience it for themselves, then they're not going to forget it.  You know, they're going to really buy into it, so...

Yeah, um, I think...I mean, again it goes back that, doing is learning, and I think, um, I think there's a lot more hands-on type experiments and activities you can do with students.  You know, science lends itself to being a hands-on field, um, so I think the kids really learn best by doing, and I think that science really allows them to get their hands wet or dirty, or however you want to say it, and like really experience it for themselves.  So, um, I think really good math teachers also can achieve that, but I, I was struggling with that as a math teacher, so I will leave that to the really good math teachers.

Hmm, hmm.  Uh, teaching is the passing of knowledge from one person to another, and it comes in many forms, I would say.

Interviewer:

Okay.  Um, can you think of an example of an experience that may have changed your definition of teaching over time?

Karen:

Hmm.  Uh, I can't really think of anything right now.  Uh, I guess, like, I guess the classic thinking of teaching is thinking of a teacher in a classroom, and so, you know, I've been trying to think about teaching more mobility, I guess.  So, uh, maybe like a tutoring relationship might be different than a classroom-teacher relationship, or a coach relationship.  I can't really think of a specific example; I don't know.

Being a ninja, primarily.  I was a ninja for my last three years at Olin, basically as long as I could be a ninja for, and I did ICB math and physics and then I did what is now called _____ [00:15:17] or modcon  or whatever the first-year students do electric stuff in is called now.

Codes:  [things they call teachers]

Um, and the reason that that was such a powerful experience for me was because unlike the other ninjas, who had been asked to ninja the class because they did really well in it, I was a student that went to the professors and said, 'Hey, I almost flunked out of this class my first year.  I'd really like to learn the material because I don't understand it well.  Um, I know I learn very well by teaching stuff.  Can I be your ninja?  I will learn things one week ahead of the first years.'  And so, in a leap of faith, they, they hired me.  I am still shocked that they did that, but I'm very grateful.  So they hired me, and that was my experience of being the ninja who had almost failed the class and she was sort of relearning all the things right before I walked into tutorial and watched my students kind of rediscover them with me.  And, and because of that, I think I was able to have a different kind of interaction because some of the other ninjas, they had a hard time understanding why you wouldn't understand the material.  They were, like, 'Oh, well, well, this, is, this is really obvious and easy for me.  I don't see why you don't get it.'  I mean, being really kind and patient and everything, but just not having had that experience, whereas I could go, 'Yeap, I know exactly what it feels like to just barely be passing and sometimes not be passing this class.'

Yeah.  I mean, I think, um, there's a lot of different stuff, um, and my role shifted a lot over the course of the year, um, from initial...after sort of, like, helping people understand bicycles and, like, what are the different parts.  Um, early on, a lot of the team members were frustrated when myself and one of the other team members who had a lot of bike experience would be talking about particular components using words that, like, the rest of the team didn't understand, had no context for, um, and so, we had to step back and, like, sort of build up basic knowledge and then launch into, um, the real sort of synthesis or teamwork around creating something, um, new and, um, like, collaboratively.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and I think that the...later on in the project, um, I shifted towards, um, a less active, um, management style where I was more focused on aligning people's skills and interests with, like, tasks that needed to be done, um, so, sort of guiding them, providing them with the support that they needed to be able to utilize their own abilities to get things done rather than trying to, um, sort of get them to follow whatever I was doing.
[00:44:47]
I: Hmm, hmm.  Okay. Um, so, I...sorry, I'm, I'm interested about the fact that you describe this role as alternately, um, being a manager or being a mentor, right.  Um, so, can you, you talk to be a little bit more about what sort of role you felt like you were playing there?

P: Yeah.  I mean, at the time I certainly thought of it, um, mostly as sort of management.  Like, there...we had sort of a deliverable that we wanted to, um, deliver, um, and there's a lot of, like, sub-tasks to get to that deliverable, um, and so, finding the way to manage the work to, um, make sure that it got done and it was done, um, in a timely manner and as best as possible, so a lot of that was more on the management side.  But, um, again, the role that I eventually shifted into was more...um, less of a task...to some extent, a task manager but also, um, sort of a mentor, of, like, making sure that everybody had the, um, the tools and the resources and the abilities to, like, fulfill whatever tasks, um, were put before them.  Um, and so, I shifted from early on in the semester where I was doing a lot of the work on my own to later on in the year, um, doing almost none of the work myself and, like, just making sure that everybody had everything that they needed, um, to be able to get...like, sort of do the work on their own.

I: Hmm, hmm.

P: Um, and through that process, like, building up the skills of people who, um, like, again, had no background in bicycles, that may have no background in mechanical engineering, no background in...um, or, like, limited comfort with solid works, um, and so, sort of making sure that everybody had that, um, and providing the individual attention that was needed to make sure that they had what they needed out of that.

Um, and, like, he...I mean, I guess, that's sort of...that's, like, the act-...the activity of ninjaing  obviously, like, influenced me into teaching as well, but also just, like, Mark and the way that he...like, we would have ninja meetings between...like, all the ninjas and the professors would, like, be there and we would talk about, like, what was going to...what had hap-...been happening in the class and, like, if there were students we were concerned about or if things weren't quite clicking for students as well as we wanted them to, um, but all...and then, like, what was going to happen in the class and, like, what sort of the goals were for the next week for students.  Um, and so, I think, like, that sort of...like, I guess that mentorship where...like, over, over the course of three years of ninjaing  mod sim, I think my understanding of the class and its goals and how to, like, get students towards that...those understandings really, like, evolved and, like, all of those, like, ninja conversations with Mark I think, like, helped me a lot, especially in, like, my understanding of, like, projects, like...um, because there's, like, the diagnostics which are just the homework assignments in some of the projects in mod sym and, like, the...it was easy enough, like, from my first time ninjaing  to, like, help students with diagnostics because they're, like...I mean, they're not...they're pr-...they're somewhat open ended but they also, like, have some pretty clear answers and, like, everybody's doing the same thing and so, like, that's fairly straightforward to help students with.  Um, but then projects can be, like, a lot more challenging because, like, students are all kind of taking things in their own direction and then, you know, like, 'I don't know what's right, or I don't know what kind of advice I should be giving them right now.'  Um, and I think, like, a, a lot of the ninja conversations with Mark, like, helped me learn to do that better, um, and learn to, like...helped me, like, see...he has really good way of, like, framing the big picture of things that I think would just really...it helped me teach mod sim better but also was just, like, inspiring for me as a teacher, like, to want to be able to do that for my students as well.

There was a time when a lot of the courses were these, uh, mandatory one-day things, or, um, and people just really didn't enjoy them, and they weren't getting out of them what they needed.  And so, what they ended up doing was making it a, uh, more like a mentorship program, where they teach you the basics almost for an hour or two the first day, and then they come back and see you for an hour or so, every day for the next week or two.  And that was your chance to ask questions and your chance to hear more advanced levels of the, um, topic you were learning.  And all of a sudden, it worked.  You know, people were getting it.  They were incorporating it into their work.  They were happy to learn it, and they all had different questions.  Every single one of them came at it from a different angle, and it made it very, very clear why the original one-day course wasn't working, and why this kind of mentorship program over their first two weeks was much more effective.  Um, everyone had different elements of the job to incorporate into what they already knew, and we had tailored it so that not only did they get to incorporate those elements into their lives; they got to practice the ones that they weren't good at.
