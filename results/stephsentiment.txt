I want to encourage you to share examples and stories with your answers, since we've found this really helpful for us to understand what you're talking about.  I'll be using a so-called semi-structured interview protocol, which means I have a set of questions that I want to make sure we address, but there'll be also room for us to explore other topics that you want to discuss with me.  Okay?

(0.5, 0.5)
