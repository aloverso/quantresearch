Um, I'm part of an Olin based Reu, RET team of researchers that's assessing the participating of Olin students and alumni in teaching related activities, and research on education.  Specifically, we're trying to identify factors in the lives of Olin students and alumni that contribute to the desire of our students and alumni to engage or not in education.  Whether through teaching related activities at K through 12 or higher education levels, through mentorship, coaching activities, or training in various industry related workshops.  This interview is a follow up to a survey you completed this summer.  Thank you so much for completing that study and helping us out.  Uh, before we go on, I'd like to mention that you have read, understood, and signed the consent form?
