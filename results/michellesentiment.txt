So, um, thinking holistically about your educational experience at Olin, right?  Everything.  Lecture-based courses, interactions with your peers, team work -- so, the whole package.  Um, has the gender balance at Olin shaped your learning, that kind of holistic learning experience at Olin, and how?

So, we are on.  Okay, so, with this, let me start.  Um, so today is March 6, um, and I'm speaking with alum, Olin alum Michelle.  I'm going to call her Michelle for the purposes of this interview.  Um, this is Interviewer [ph], and we are having this interview via Skype.  So, let me have...let me ask you a few questions, um, to kind of get us started.  And the first question is How did you become interested in engineering?

So, for you...I mean, this is an interesting description, right?  So, I'm wondering here, I'm sitting here and I'm wondering:  Is it a necessary condition for you to have a connection with the students whom you teach, or could you...but, do you need the connection?  Does wanting it...

Um, so, it sounds to me like a, very like holistic, big definition, of teaching that you have now.  Have you had any experiences that kind of brought you here?  Like, can you think of experiences that allowed you to change this definition to come to the current one?  Of teaching; I'm talking about the definition of teaching.

Gotcha.  And are you doing any teaching now?  No.  Actually, it's funny.  This is like a perfectly timed interview.  I, um, I just applied to go to graduate school, to get my master's in teaching for middle school math.  So, that's to become certified here in South Carolina, and then to get my master's in teaching, my MaT.  So that'll be a two-year program that I start in the fall, which I'm really excited about.

Um, and the second, the second interesting thing that you told me was that your physics teacher told you that you should consider engineering, and then you ended up at Olin, but between then...between the suggestion from your physics teacher, Dr. Diller, and the time that you actually decided to do engineering, had you thought about engineering?  Had you, like, actually...

Welcome home.  Um, you have mentioned by now several different events, and some of them you mentioned several times, and you mentioned some people to me.  So, the question that I have for you is:  What is, what has been a major personal influence?  And that could be a person, that could be an event, that could be a set of events.  But what has it...what is that thing that has been a major personal influence that has affected your life?  Or future plans, let's say.

Wow.  So, you, you, I mean, you've nicely...what you have done for me nicely is you've connected, kind of, the concept of teaching with the concept of learning, but you mostly spoke about learning of others.  So what I want to do is now kind of revert it and ask you a question about your learning experiences, and what I'm particularly interested in is learning experiences that made you understand differently, something different about yourself and the ways in which you learn.  Does the question make sense?
